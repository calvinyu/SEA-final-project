S"In [[natural language processing]], '''semantic compression''' is a process of compacting a lexicon used to build \na textual document (or a set of documents) by reducing language heterogeneity, while maintaining text [[semantics]]. \nAs a result, the same ideas can be represented using a smaller set of words.\n\nSemantic compression is a [[lossy compression]], that is, some data is being discarded, and an original document \ncannot be reconstructed in a reverse process.\n\n==Semantic compression by generalization==\nSemantic compression is basically achieved in two steps, using [[frequency list|frequency dictionaries]] and [[semantic network]]:\n#\tdetermining cumulated term frequencies to identify target lexicon,\n#\treplacing less frequent terms with their hypernyms ([[generalization]]) from target lexicon.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12090-9_10 D. Ceglarek, K. Haniewicz, W. Rutkowski, Semantic Compression for Specialised Information Retrieval Systems], Advances in Intelligent Information and Database Systems, vol. 283, p. 111-121, 2010</ref>\n\nStep 1 requires assembling word frequencies and \ninformation on semantic relationships, specifically [[hyponymy]]. Moving upwards in word hierarchy, \na cumulative concept frequency is calculating by adding a sum of hyponyms' frequencies to frequency of their hypernym:\n<math>cum f(k_{i}) = f(k_{i}) + \\sum_{j} cum f(k_{j})</math> where <math>k_{i}</math> is a hypernym of <math>k_{j}</math>.\nThen, a desired number of words with top cumulated frequencies are chosen to build a targed lexicon.\n\nIn the second step, compression mapping rules are defined for the remaining words, in order to handle every occurrence \nof a less frequent hyponym as its hypernym in output text.\n\n;Example\n\nThe below fragment of text has been processed by the semantic compression. Words in bold have been replaced by their hypernyms.\n\n<blockquote>They are both '''nest''' building '''social insects''', but '''paper wasps''' and honey '''bees''' '''organize''' their '''colonies''' \nin very different '''ways'''. In a new study, researchers report that despite their '''differences''', these insects \n'''rely on''' the same network of genes to guide their '''social behavior'''.The study appears in the Proceedings of the \n'''Royal Society B''': Biological Sciences. Honey '''bees''' and '''paper wasps''' are separated by more than 100 million years of \n'''evolution''', and there are '''striking differences''' in how they divvy up the work of '''maintaining''' a '''colony'''.</blockquote>\n\nThe procedure outputs the following text:\n\n<blockquote>They are both '''facility''' building '''insect''', but '''insect''' and honey '''insects''' '''arrange''' their '''biological groups''' \nin very different '''structure'''. In a new study, researchers report that despite their '''difference of opinions''', these insects \n'''act''' the same network of genes to '''steer''' their '''party demeanor'''. The study appears in the proceeding of the \n'''institution bacteria''' Biological Sciences. Honey '''insects''' and '''insect''' are separated by more than hundred million years of \n'''organic process''', and there are '''impinging difference of opinions''' in how they divvy up the work of '''affirming''' a '''biological group'''.</blockquote>\n\n==Implicit semantic compression==\nA natural tendency to keep natural language expressions concise can be perceived as a form of implicit semantic compression, by omitting unmeaningful words or redundant meaningful words (especially to avoid [[pleonasm]]s)\n.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/990100.990155 N.

Percova, On the types of semantic compression of text],\nCOLING '82 Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Computational Linguistics, vol. 2, p. 229-231, 1982</ref>\n\n==Applications and advantages==\nIn the [[vector space model]], compacting a lexicon leads to a reduction of [[curse of dimensionality|dimensionality]], which results in less \n[[computational complexity]] and a positive influence on efficiency. \n\nSemantic compression is advantageous in information retrieval tasks, improving their effectiveness (in terms of both precision and recall).<ref>[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1947662.1947683 D.

S'\'\'\'Document retrieval\'\'\' is defined as the matching of some stated user query against a set of [[free-text]] records. These records could be any type of mainly [[natural language|unstructured text]], such as [[newspaper article]]s, real estate records or paragraphs in a manual. User queries can range from multi-sentence full descriptions of an information need to a few words.\n\nDocument retrieval is sometimes referred to as, or as a branch of, \'\'\'Text Retrieval\'\'\'. Text retrieval is a branch of [[information retrieval]] where the information is stored primarily in the form of [[natural language|text]]. Text databases became decentralized thanks to the [[personal computer]] and the [[CD-ROM]]. Text retrieval is a critical area of study today, since it is the fundamental basis of all [[internet]] [[search engine]]s.\n\n==Description==\nDocument retrieval systems find information to given criteria by matching text records (\'\'documents\'\') against user queries, as opposed to [[expert system]]s that answer questions by [[Inference|inferring]] over a logical [[knowledge base|knowledge database]]. A document retrieval system consists of a database of documents, a [[classification algorithm]] to build a full text index, and a user interface to access the database.\n\nA document retrieval system has two main tasks:\n# Find relevant documents to user queries\n# Evaluate the matching results and sort them according to relevance, using algorithms such as [[PageRank]].\n\nInternet [[search engines]] are classical applications of document retrieval. The vast majority of retrieval systems currently in use range from simple Boolean systems through to systems using [[statistical]] or [[natural language processing]] techniques.\n\n==Variations==\nThere are two main classes of indexing schemata for document retrieval systems: \'\'form based\'\' (or \'\'word based\'\'), and \'\'content based\'\' indexing. The document classification scheme (or [[Search engine indexing|indexing algorithm]]) in use determines the nature of the document retrieval system.\n\n===Form based===\nForm based document retrieval addresses the exact syntactic properties of a text, comparable to substring matching in string searches. The text is generally unstructured and not necessarily in a natural language, the system could for example be used to process large sets of chemical representations in molecular biology. A [[suffix tree]] algorithm is an example for form based indexing.\n\n===Content based===\nThe content based approach exploits semantic connections between documents and parts thereof, and semantic connections between queries and documents. Most content based document retrieval systems use an [[inverted index]] algorithm.\n\nA \'\'signature file\'\' is a technique that creates a \'\'quick and dirty\'\' filter, for example a [[Bloom filter]], that will keep all the documents that match to the query and \'\'hopefully\'\' a few ones that do not. The way this is done is by creating for each file a signature, typically a hash coded version. One method is superimposed coding. A post-processing step is done to discard the false alarms. Since in most cases this structure is inferior to [[inverted file]]s in terms of speed, size and functionality, it is not used widely. However, with proper parameters it can beat the inverted files in certain environments.\n\n==Example: PubMed==\nThe [[PubMed]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim W, Aronson AR, Wilbur WJ |title=Automatic MeSH term assignment and quality assessment |journal=Proc AMIA Symp |pages=319\xe2\x80\x9323 |year=2001 |pmid=11825203 |pmc=2243528 }}\n</ref> form interface features the "related articles" search which works through a comparison of words from the documents\' title, abstract, and [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] terms using a word-weighted algorithm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#pubmedhelp.Computation_of_Related_Citati|title=Computation of Related Citations}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=Oct 30, 2007|volume=8|pages=423|pmid=17971238|title=PubMed related articles: a probabilistic topic-based model for content similarity|author=Lin J1, Wilbur WJ|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-8-423|pmc=2212667}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Compound term processing]]\n* [[Document classification]]\n* [[Enterprise search]]\n* [[Full text search]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[Latent semantic indexing]]\n* [[Search engine]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|first1=Christos|last1=Faloutsos|first2=Stavros|last2=Christodoulakis|title=Signature files: An access method for documents and its analytical performance evaluation|journal=ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)|volume=2|issue=4|year=1984|pages=267\xe2\x80\x93288|doi=10.1145/2275.357411}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Justin Zobel, Alistair Moffat and Kotagiri Ramamohanarao|title=Inverted files versus signature files for text indexing|journal=ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS)|volume=23|issue=4|year=1998|pages= 453\xe2\x80\x93490|url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/Qual/Papers/19%20-%20Inverted%20files%20versus%20signature%20files%20for%20text%20indexing.pdf|doi=10.1145/296854.277632}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Ben Carterette and Fazli Can|title=Comparing inverted files and signature files for searching a large lexicon|journal=Information Processing and Management|volume= 41|issue=3|year=2005|pages= 613\xe2\x80\x93633|url=http://www.users.miamioh.edu/canf/papers/ipm04b.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2003.12.003}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cir.dcs.uni-pannon.hu/cikkek/FINAL_DOMINICH.pdf Formal Foundation of Information Retrieval], Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Electronic documents]]\n[[Category:Substring indices]]\n\n[[zh:\xe6\x96\x87\xe6\x9c\xac\xe4\xbf\xa1\xe6\x81\xaf\xe6\xa3\x80\xe7\xb4\xa2]]'

S'\'\'\'Natural Language User Interfaces\'\'\' (LUI or NLUI) are a type of [[User interface|computer human interface]] where linguistic phenomena such as verbs, phrases and clauses act as UI controls for creating, selecting and modifying data in software applications.\n\nIn [[interface design]] natural language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use, but most suffer the challenges to [[natural language understanding|understanding]] wide varieties of ambiguous input.<ref>Hill, I. (1983). "Natural language versus computer language." In M. Sime and M. Coombs (Eds.) Designing for Human-Computer Communication. Academic Press.</ref>\nNatural language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]]. An intuitive general Natural language interface is one of the active goals of the [[Semantic Web]].\n\nText interfaces are \'natural\' to varying degrees. Many formal (un-natural) programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language. Likewise, a traditional [[keyword search]] engine could be described as a \'shallow\' Natural language user interface.\n\n==Overview==\nA natural language search engine would in theory find targeted answers to user questions (as opposed to keyword search). For example, when confronted with a question of the form \'which [[United States|U.S.]] state has the highest [[income tax]]?\', conventional search engines ignore the question and instead search on the [[index term|keywords]] \'state\', \'income\' and \'tax\'. Natural language search, on the other hand, attempts to use natural language processing to understand the nature of the question and then to search and return a subset of the web that contains the answer to the question. If it works, results would have a higher relevance than results from a keyword search engine.\n\n==History==\n\nPrototype Nl interfaces had already appeared in the late sixties and early seventies.<ref name="edin">Natural Language Interfaces to Databases \xe2\x80\x93 An Introduction,\nI.

On the part of the user, this has led to unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system. Such expectations will make it difficult to learn the restrictions of the system if users attribute too much capability to it, and will ultimately lead to disappointment when the system fails to perform as expected as was the case in the [[AI winter]] of the 1970s and 80s.\n\nA [http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9503016 1995 paper] titled \'Natural Language Interfaces to Databases \xe2\x80\x93 An Introduction\', describes some challenges:<ref name="edin"/>\n* \'\'Modifier attachment\'\'\nThe request \xe2\x80\x9cList all employees in the company with a driving licence\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous unless you know companies can\'t have drivers licences.\n\n* \'\'Conjunction and disjunction\'\'\n\xe2\x80\x9cList all applicants who live in California and Arizona\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous unless you know that a person can\'t live in two places at once.\n* \'\'[[Anaphora resolution]]\'\'\n- resolve what a user means by \'he\', \'she\' or \'it\', in a self-referential query.\n\nOther goals to consider more generally are the speed and efficiency of the interface, in all algorithms these two points are the main point that will determine if some methods are better than others and therefore have greater success in the market.\n\nFinally, regarding the methods used, the main problem to be solved is creating a general algorithm that can recognize the entire spectrum of different voices, while disregarding nationality, gender or age. The significant differences between the extracted features - even from speakers who says the same word or phrase - must be successfully overcome.\n\n==Uses and applications==\n\nThe natural language interface gives rise to technology used for many different applications. \n\nSome of the main uses are:\n\n* \'\'Dictation\'\', is the most common use for [[automated speech recognition]] (ASR) systems today. This includes medical transcriptions, legal and business dictation, and general word processing. In some cases special vocabularies are used to increase the accuracy of the system.\n* \'\'Command and control\'\', ASR systems that are designed to perform functions and actions on the system are defined as command and control systems. Utterances like "Open Netscape" and "Start a new xterm" will do just that.\n* \'\'Telephony\'\', some PBX/[[Voice Mail]] systems allow callers to speak commands instead of pressing buttons to send specific tones.\n* \'\'Wearables\'\', because inputs are limited for wearable devices, speaking is a natural possibility.\n* \'\'Medical, disabilities\'\', many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such as repetitive strain injuries (RSI), muscular dystrophy, and many others. For example, people with difficulty hearing could use a system connected to their telephone to convert a caller\'s speech to text.\n* \'\'Embedded applications\'\', some new cellular phones include C&C speech recognition that allow utterances such as "call home". This may be a major factor in the future of automatic speech recognition and [[Linux]].\n\nBelow are named and defined some of the applications that use natural language recognition, and so have integrated utilities listed above.\n\n===Ubiquity===\n{{main|Ubiquity (Firefox)}}\nUbiquity, an [[add-on (Mozilla)|add-on]] for [[Mozilla Firefox]], is a collection of quick and easy natural-language-derived commands that act as [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]] of web services, thus allowing users to get information and relate it to current and other webpages.\n\n===Wolfram Alpha===\n{{main|Wolfram Alpha}}\nWolfram Alpha is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a [[search engine]] would.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/mar/09/search-engine-google |title=British search engine \'could rival Google\' |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=2009-03-09 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref> It was announced in March 2009 by [[Stephen Wolfram]], and was released to the public on May 15, 2009.<ref name="launch date">{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/05/08/so-much-for-a-quiet-launch/ |title=So Much for A Quiet Launch |publisher=Wolfram Alpha Blog |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>\n\n===Siri===\n{{main|Siri (software)}}\nSiri is a [[personal assistant]] application for the operating system [[iOS]].

Both names also see "similarity coefficient", "index", and other such variations. Common alternate spellings for S\xc3\xb8rensen are Sorenson, Soerenson index and S\xc3\xb6renson index, and all three can also be seen with the \xe2\x80\x93sen ending.\n\nOther names include:\n*[[Jan Czekanowski|Czekanowski]]\'s binary (non-quantitative) index<ref name ="gallagher"/>\n\n==Quantitative version==\nThe expression is easily extended to [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] instead of presence/absence of species.

For example, to calculate the similarity between:\n\n:<code>night</code>\n:<code>nacht</code>\n\nWe would find the set of bigrams in each word:\n:{<code>ni</code>,<code>ig</code>,<code>gh</code>,<code>ht</code>}\n:{<code>na</code>,<code>ac</code>,<code>ch</code>,<code>ht</code>}\n\nEach set has four elements, and the intersection of these two sets has only one element: <code>ht</code>.\n\nInserting these numbers into the formula, we calculate, \'\'s\'\'&nbsp;=&nbsp;(2&nbsp;\xc2\xb7&nbsp;1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.25.\n\n==Difference from Jaccard ==\nThis coefficient is not very different in form from the [[Jaccard index]].

Unlike Jaccard, the corresponding difference function\n\n:<math>d = 1 -  \\frac{2 | X \\cap Y |}{| X | + | Y |} </math>\n\nis not a proper distance metric as it does not possess the property of [[triangle inequality]].<ref name ="gallagher">Gallagher, E.D., 1999.

To satisfy the triangle inequality, the sum of \'\'any\'\' two of these three sides must be greater than or equal to the remaining side. However, the distance between {a} and {a,b} plus the distance between {b} and {a,b} equals 2/3 and is therefore less than the distance between {a} and {b} which is 1.\n\n==Applications==\nThe S\xc3\xb8rensen\xe2\x80\x93Dice coefficient is mainly useful for ecological community data (e.g. Looman & Campbell, 1960<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9658%28196007%2941%3A3%3C409%3AAOSK%28F%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 Looman, J. and Campbell, J.B.

S'A \'\'\'web search query\'\'\' is a query that a user enters into a web [[search engine]] to satisfy his or her [[information needs]]. Web search queries are distinctive in that they are often plain text or [[hypertext]] with optional search-directives (such as "and"/"or" with "-" to exclude). They vary greatly from standard [[query language]]s, which are governed by strict syntax rules as [[command language]]s with keyword or positional [[Parameter (computer science)|parameters]].\n\n== Types ==\nThere are three broad categories that cover most web search queries: informational, navigational, and transactional. These are often called "do, know, go."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Kevin|title=Do, Know, Go: How to Create Content at Each Stage of the Buying Cycle|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2235624/Do-Know-Go-How-to-Create-Content-at-Each-Stage-of-the-Buying-Cycle|publisher=Search Engine Watch|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n* \'\'\'Informational queries\'\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 Queries that cover a broad topic (e.g., \'\'colorado\'\' or \'\'trucks\'\') for which there may be thousands of relevant results.\n\n* \'\'\'Navigational queries\'\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 Queries that seek a single website or web page of a single entity (e.g., \'\'youtube\'\' or \'\'delta air lines\'\').\n\n* \'\'\'Transactional queries\'\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 Queries that reflect the intent of the user to perform a particular action, like purchasing a car or downloading a screen saver.\n\nSearch engines often support a fourth type of query that is used far less frequently:\n\n* \'\'\'Connectivity queries\'\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 Queries that report on the connectivity of the indexed [[web graph]] (e.g., Which links point to this [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]?, and How many pages are indexed from this [[domain name]]?).<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Ross|title=Connectivity servers|url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/connectivity-servers-1.html|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nMost commercial web search engines do not disclose their search logs, so information about what users are searching for on the Web is difficult to come by.<ref>Dawn Kawamoto and Elinor Mills (2006), [http://news.cnet.com/AOL-apologizes-for-release-of-user-search-data/2100-1030_3-6102793.html AOL apologizes for release of user search data]</ref> Nevertheless, a study in 2001<ref>{{cite journal|author = Amanda Spink, Dietmar Wolfram, Major B.

S'{{hatnote|Not to be confused with [[Markup language]] or [[HTML element]] tags.}}\n[[File:Web 2.0 Map.svg|thumb|right|250px|A [[tag cloud]] with terms related to [[Web 2.0]]]]\n\nIn [[information system]]s, a \'\'\'tag\'\'\' is a non-hierarchical [[index term|keyword or term]] assigned to a piece of information (such as an [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|Internet bookmark]], digital image, or [[computer file]]). This kind of [[metadata]] helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching. Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the item\'s creator or by its viewer, depending on the system.\n\nTagging was popularized by websites associated with [[Web 2.0]] and is an important feature of many Web 2.0 services. It is now also part of some desktop software.\n\n==History==\n\nLabeling and tagging are carried out to perform functions such as aiding in [[Classification (machine learning)|classification]], marking ownership, noting boundaries, and indicating [[online identity]]. They may take the form of words, images, or other identifying marks. An analogous example of tags in the physical world is museum object tagging. In the organization of information and objects, the use of textual keywords as part of identification and classification long  predates computers. However, computer based searching made the use of keywords a rapid way of exploring records.\n\n[[File:A Description of the Equator and Some Otherlands, collaborative hypercinema portal Upload page.jpg|thumb|A Description of the Equator and Some Otherlands, collaborative hypercinema portal, produced by documenta X, 1997. User upload page associating user contributed media with the term \'\'Tag\'\'.]] Online and Internet databases and early websites deployed them as a way for publishers to help users find content. In 1997, the collaborative portal "A Description of the Equator and Some Other Lands" produced by [[documenta]] X, Germany, coined the folksonomic term \'\'Tag\'\' for its co-authors and guest authors on its Upload page. In "The Equator" the term \'\'Tag\'\' for user-input was described as an \'\'abstract literal or keyword\'\' to aid the user. Turned out in Web 1.0 days, all "Otherlands" users defined singular \'\'Tags\'\', and did not share \'\'Tags\'\' at that point.\n\nIn 2003, the [[social bookmarking]] website [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]] provided a way for its users to add "tags" to their bookmarks (as a way to help find them later); Delicious also provided browseable aggregated views of the bookmarks of all users featuring a particular tag.<ref>[http://flickr.com/photos/joshu/765809051/in/set-72157600740166824/ Screenshot of tags on del.icio.us] in 2004 and [http://flickr.com/photos/joshu/765817375/in/set-72157600740166824/ Screenshot of a tag page on del.icio.us], also in 2004, both published by [[Joshua Schachter]] on July 9, 2007.</ref> [[Flickr]] allowed its users to add their own text tags to each of their pictures, constructing flexible and easy metadata that made the pictures highly searchable.<ref>[http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/essays/archives/000519.php "An Interview with Flickr\'s Eric Costello"] by Jesse James Garrett, published on August 4, 2005. Quote: "Tags were not in the initial version of Flickr. Stewart Butterfield...liked the way they worked on del.icio.us, the social bookmarking application. We added very simple tagging functionality, so you could tag your photos, and then look at all your photos with a particular tag, or any one person\xe2\x80\x99s photos with a particular tag."</ref> The success of Flickr and the influence of Delicious popularized the concept,<ref>An example is [http://www.adammathes.com/academic/computer-mediated-communication/folksonomies.html "Folksonomies - Cooperative Classification and Communication Through Shared Metadata"] by Adam Mathes, December 2004. It focuses on tagging in Delicious and Flickr.</ref> and other [[social software]] websites&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 such as [[YouTube]], [[Technorati]], and [[Last.fm]]&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 also implemented tagging. Other traditional and web applications have incorporated the concept such as "Labels" in [[Gmail]] and the ability to add and edit tags in [[iTunes]] or [[Winamp]].\n\nTagging has gained wide popularity due to the growth of social networking, photography sharing and bookmarking sites. These sites allow users to create and manage labels (or \xe2\x80\x9ctags\xe2\x80\x9d) that categorize content using simple keywords. The use of keywords as part of an identification and classification system long predates computers. In the early days of the web keywords meta tags were used by web page designers to tell search engines what the web page was about. Today\'s tagging takes the meta keywords concept and re-uses it. The users add the tags. The tags are clearly visible, and are themselves links to other items that share that keyword tag.\n\nKnowledge tags are an extension of [[Index term|keyword]] tags. They were first used by [[Jumper 2.0]], an [[open source]] [[Web 2.0]] software platform released by Jumper Networks on 29 September 2008.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.jumpernetworks.com/ NEWS-Jumper_Networks_Releases_Jumper_2.0_Platform.pdf|title=Jumper Networks Press Release for Jumper 2.0|publisher=Jumper Networks, Inc.|date=29 September 2008}}</ref> Jumper 2.0 was the first [[collaborative search engine]] platform to use a method of expanded tagging for [[knowledge capture]].\n\nWebsites that include tags often display collections of tags as [[tag cloud]]s. A user\'s tags are useful both to them and to the larger community of the website\'s users.\n\nTags may be a "bottom-up" type of classification, compared to [[hierarchy|hierarchies]], which are "top-down". In a traditional hierarchical system ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]), the designer sets out a limited number of terms to use for classification, and there is one correct way to classify each item. In a tagging system, there are an unlimited number of ways to classify an item, and there is no "wrong" choice. Instead of belonging to one category, an item may have several different tags. Some researchers and applications have experimented with combining structured hierarchy and "flat" tagging to aid in information retrieval.<ref>[http://infolab.stanford.edu/~heymann/taghierarchy.html Tag Hierarchies], research notes by Paul Heymann.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n=== Within a Blog ===\nMany [[blog]] systems allow authors to add free-form tags to a post, along with (or instead of) placing the post into categories. For example, a post may display that it has been tagged with \'\'baseball\'\' and \'\'tickets\'\'. Each of those tags is usually a [[web link]] leading to an index page listing all of the posts associated with that tag. The blog may have a sidebar listing all the tags in use on that blog, with each tag leading to an index page. To reclassify a post, an author edits its list of tags. All connections between posts are automatically tracked and updated by the blog software; there is no need to relocate the page within a complex hierarchy of categories.\n\n===For an event===\nAn official tag is a keyword adopted by events and conferences for participants to use in their web publications, such as blog entries, photos of the event, and presentation slides. Search engines can then index them to make relevant materials related to the event searchable in a uniform way. In this case, the tag is part of a [[controlled vocabulary]].\n\n===In research===\nA researcher may work with a large collection of items (e.g. press quotes, a bibliography, images) in digital form. If he/she wishes to associate each with a small number of themes (e.g. to chapters of a book, or to sub-themes of the overall subject), then a group of tags for these themes can be attached to each of the items in the larger collection. In this way, free form [[categorization|classification]] allows the author to manage what would otherwise be unwieldy amounts of information. Commercial, as well as some free computer applications are readily available to do this.\n\n==Special types==\n===Triple tags===\n{{see also|Microformat}}\nA \'\'\'triple tag\'\'\' or \'\'\'machine tag\'\'\' uses a special [[syntax]] to define extra [[semantic]] information about the tag, making it easier or more meaningful for interpretation by a computer program. Triple tags comprise three parts: a [[namespace]], a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]], and a value. For example, "geo:long=50.123456" is a tag for the geographical [[longitude]] coordinate whose value is 50.123456. This triple structure is similar to the [[Resource Description Framework]] model for information.\n\nThe triple tag format was first devised for geolicious<ref>[http://brainoff.com/weblog/2004/11/05/124 geo.lici.us : geotagging hosted services] by Mikel Maron, November 5, 2004.</ref> in November 2004, to map [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]] bookmarks, and gained wider acceptance after its adoption by [http://stamen.com/projects/mappr Mappr] and GeoBloggers<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071011024028/http://geobloggers.com/archives/2006/01/11/advanced-tagging-and-tripletags/ Advanced Tagging and TripleTags] by Reverend Dan Catt, \'\'Geobloggers\'\', January 11, 2006.</ref> to map [[Flickr]] photos. In January 2007, [[Aaron Straup Cope]] at [[Flickr]] introduced the term \'\'machine tag\'\' as an alternative name for the triple tag, adding some questions and answers on purpose, syntax, and use.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/ Machine tags], a post by Aaron Straup Cope in the Flickr API group, January 24, 2007.</ref>\n\nSpecialized metadata for geographical identification is known as \'\'[[geotagging]]\'\'; machine tags are also used for other purposes, such as identifying photos taken at a specific event or naming species using [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life/rules/ Encyclopedia of Life use of machine tag], The Encyclopedia of Life project rules including the required use of a taxonomy machine tag, September 19, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Hashtags===\n{{main|Hashtag}}\nA hashtag is a kind of metadata tag marked by the prefix <code>#</code>, sometimes known as a "hash" symbol. This form of tagging is used on [[microblogging]] and [[social networking service]]s such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], [[VK (social network)|VK]] and [[Instagram]].\n\n===Knowledge tags===\nA knowledge tag is a type of [[metadata|meta-information]] that describes or defines some aspect of an information resource (such as a [[document]], [[digital image]], [[database table|relational table]], or [[web page]]). Knowledge tags are more than traditional non-hierarchical [[index term|keywords or terms]]. They are a type of [[metadata]] that captures knowledge in the form of descriptions, categorizations, classifications, [[semantics]], comments, notes, annotations, [[hyperdata]], [[hyperlinks]], or references that are collected in tag profiles. These tag profiles reference an information resource that resides in a distributed, and often heterogeneous, storage repository. Knowledge tags are a [[knowledge management]] discipline that leverages [[Enterprise 2.0]] methodologies for users to capture insights, expertise, attributes, dependencies, or relationships associated with a data resource. It generally allows greater flexibility than other [[knowledge management]] classification systems.\n\nCapturing knowledge in tags takes many different forms, there is factual knowledge (that found in books and data), conceptual knowledge (found in perspectives and concepts), expectational knowledge (needed to make judgments and hypothesis), and methodological knowledge (derived from reasoning and strategies).<ref>\n{{Citation\n | last=Wiig | first=K.

Hierarchical classification systems can be slow to change, and are rooted in the culture and era that created them.<ref name="Smith2008">Smith, Gene (2008). Tagging: People-Powered Metadata for the Social Web. Berkeley, CA: New Riders. ISBN 0-321-52917-0</ref> The flexibility of tagging allows users to classify their collections of items in the ways that they find useful, but the personalized variety of terms can present challenges when searching and browsing.\n\nWhen users can freely choose tags (creating a [[folksonomy]], as opposed to selecting terms from a [[controlled vocabulary]]), the resulting metadata can include [[homonym]]s (the same tags used with different meanings) and [[synonym]]s (multiple tags for the same concept), which may lead to inappropriate connections between items and inefficient searches for information about a subject.<ref>Golder, Scott A. Huberman, Bernardo A. (2005).\n"[http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DL/0508082 The Structure of Collaborative Tagging Systems]." Information Dynamics Lab, HP Labs. Visited November 24, 2005.</ref> For example, the tag "orange" may refer to the [[Orange (fruit)|fruit]] or the [[Orange (colour)|color]], and items related to a version of the [[Linux kernel]] may be tagged "Linux", "kernel", "Penguin", "software", or a variety of other terms. Users can also choose tags that are different [[inflection]]s of words (such as singular and plural),<ref>[http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2004/Dec/24/SvP.tags Singular vs. plural tags in a tag-based categorization system] by Keith Devens, December 24, 2004.</ref> which can contribute to navigation difficulties if the system does not include [[stemming]] of tags when searching or browsing. Larger-scale folksonomies address some of the problems of tagging, in that users of tagging systems tend to notice the current use of "tag terms" within these systems, and thus use existing tags in order to easily form connections to related items. In this way, folksonomies collectively develop a partial set of tagging conventions.\n\n===Complex system dynamics===\n\nDespite the apparent lack of control, research has shown that a simple form of shared vocabularies emerges in social bookmarking systems. Collaborative tagging exhibits a form of [[complex system]]s dynamics,<ref name="WWW07-ref">Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602 The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging], Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW\'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211-220, ACM Press, 2007. Downloadable on [http://www2007.org/papers/paper635.pdf the conference\'s website]</ref> (or [[Self-organization|self organizing]] dynamics). Thus, even if no central controlled vocabulary constrains the actions of individual users, the distribution of tags that describe different resources (e.g., websites) converges over time to stable [[power law]] distributions.<ref name="WWW07-ref"/> Once such stable distributions form, simple vocabularies can be extracted by examining the [[correlation]]s that form between different tags.  This informal collaborative system of tag creation and management has been called a [[folksonomy]].\n\n===Spamming===\n\nTagging systems open to the public are also open to tag spam, in which people apply an excessive number of tags or unrelated tags to an item (such as a [[YouTube]] video) in order to attract viewers. This abuse can be mitigated using human or statistical identification of spam items.<ref>[http://heymann.stanford.edu/tagspam.html Tag Spam], research notes by Paul Heymann.</ref> The number of tags allowed may also be limited to reduce spam.\n\n==Syntax==\nSome tagging systems provide a single [[text box]] to enter tags, so to be able to [[tokenize]] the string, a [[Wiktionary:separator|separator]] must be used. Two popular separators are the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]] and the [[comma]]. To enable the use of separators in the tags, a system may allow for higher-level separators (such as [[quotation mark]]s) or [[escape character]]s. Systems can avoid the use of separators by allowing only one tag to be added to each input [[Web widget|widget]] at a time, although this makes adding multiple tags more time-consuming.\n\nA syntax for use within [[HTML]] is to use the \'\'\'rel-tag\'\'\' [[microformat]] which uses the [[Rel attribute|\'\'rel\'\' attribute]] with value "tag" (i.e., <code>rel="tag"</code>) to indicate that the linked-to page acts as a tag for the current context.<ref>[http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag rel tag microformat specification], Microformats Wiki, January 10, 2005.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin||27em}}\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Concept map]]\n* [[Enterprise 2.0]]\n* [[Enterprise bookmarking]]\n* [[Explicit knowledge]]\n* [[Faceted classification]]\n* [[Folksonomy]]\n* [[Information ecology]]\n* [[Knowledge representation]]\n* [[Knowledge transfer]]\n* [[Metaknowledge]]\n* [[Ontology (information science)]]\n* [[Organisational memory]]\n* [[Semantic web]]\n* [[Tag cloud]]\n* [[Web 2.0]]\n{{colend}}\n\'\'\'Others\'\'\'\n{{colbegin||27em}}\n* [[Collective unconscious]]\n* [[Human-computer interaction]]\n* [[Social network aggregation]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[Expert system]]\n* [[Knowledge]]\n* [[Knowledge base]]\n* [[Knowledge worker]]\n* [[Management information system]]\n* [[Microformats]]\n* [[Social network]]\n* [[Social software]]\n* [[Sociology of knowledge]]\n* [[Tacit Knowledge]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n\'\'\'General\'\'\'\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1=Nonaka | given1=Ikujiro\n | year=1994\n | title= A dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation\n | journal= ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/ Vol. 5, No. 1, February 1994\n | pages=14\xe2\x80\x9337\n | url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=889992\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1=Wigg | given1=Karl M  \n | year=1993  \n | title= Knowledge Management Foundations: Thinking About Thinking: How People and Organizations Create, Represent and Use Knowledge \n | journal= Arlington: Schema Press  \n | pages=153\n | url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=889992 \n}} \n*{{Citation\n | surname1=Alavi | given1=Maryam\n | surname2=Leidner | given2=Dorothy E.\n | year=1999\n | title=Knowledge management systems: issues, challenges, and benefits\n | journal=Communications of the AIS\n | volume=1| issue=2 | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=374117\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1=Sandy | given1=Kemsley\n | year=2009\n | title=Models, Social Tagging and Knowledge Management #BPM2009 #BPMS2\xe2\x80\x9909\n | journal=BPM, Enterprise 2.0 and technology trends in business\n | url=http://www.column2.com/2009/09/models-social-tagging-and-knowledge-management-bpm2009-bpms209/\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.inc.com/tech-blog/twitter-hashtag-techniques-for-businesses.html Hashtag Techniques for Businesses], Curt Finch.

S"{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:SemanticNetExample.jpg|thumb|Simplistic example of the sort of semantic net used in Semantic Web technology]]\nIn [[software]], '''semantic technology''' encodes meanings separately from data and content files, and separately from application code. \n\nThis enables machines as well as people to understand, share and reason with them at execution time. With semantic technologies, adding, changing and implementing new relationships or interconnecting programs in a different way can be just as simple as changing the external model that these programs share.\n\nWith traditional [[information technology]], on the other hand, meanings and relationships must be predefined and \xe2\x80\x9chard wired\xe2\x80\x9d into data formats and the application program code at design time. This means that when something changes, previously unexchanged information needs to be exchanged, or two programs need to interoperate in a new way, the humans must get involved.\n\nOff-line, the parties must define and communicate between them the knowledge needed to make the change, and then recode the data structures and program logic to accommodate it, and then apply these changes to the database and the application. Then, and only then, can they implement the changes.\n\nSemantic technologies are \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning-centered.\xe2\x80\x9d They include tools for:\n\n* autorecognition of topics and concepts, \n* information and meaning extraction, and\n* categorization. \n\nGiven a question, semantic technologies can directly search topics, concepts, associations that span a vast number of sources.\n\nSemantic technologies provide an abstraction layer above existing IT technologies that enables bridging and interconnection of data, content, and processes. Second, from the portal perspective, semantic technologies can be thought of as a new level of depth that provides far more intelligent, capable, relevant, and responsive interaction than with information technologies alone.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Business Intelligence 2.0]] (BI 2.0)\n* [[Metadata]]\n* [[Ontology (computer science)]]\n* [[Semantic targeting]]\n* [[Semantic web]]\n\n==References==\n\n* J.T.

S'{{Selfref|For redirection on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Redirect]].}}\n\n{{refimprove|date=July 2014}}\n\'\'\'URL redirection\'\'\', also called \'\'\'URL forwarding\'\'\', is a [[World Wide Web]] technique for making a [[web page]] available under more than one [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] address. When a [[web browser]] attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, \'\'\'domain redirection\'\'\' or \'\'\'domain forwarding\'\'\' is when all pages in a URL [[Domain name|domain]] are redirected to a different domain, as when [http://www.wikipedia.com wikipedia.com] and [http://www.wikipedia.net wikipedia.net] are automatically redirected to [http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia.org].\nURL redirection can be used for [[URL shortening]], to prevent [[link rot|broken links]] when web pages are moved, to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single [[website|web site]], to guide navigation into and out of a website, for privacy protection, and for less innocuous purposes such as [[phishing]] attacks.\n\n== Purposes ==\nThere are several reasons to use URL redirection :\n\n=== Similar domain names ===\nA user might mis-type a URL\xe2\x80\x94for example, "example.com" and "exmaple.com". Organizations often register these "mis-spelled" domains and re-direct them to the "correct" location: example.com. The addresses example.com and example.net could both redirect to a single domain, or web page, such as example.org. This technique is often used to "reserve" other [[top-level domain]]s (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a true ".edu" or ".net" to redirect to a more recognizable ".com" domain.\n\n=== Moving pages to a new domain ===\nWeb pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:\n* a site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;\n* an author might move his or her individual pages to a new domain;\n* two web sites might merge.\n\nWith URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers.\n\nThe same applies to [[search engine]]s. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a "moved permanently" redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.\n\n=== Logging outgoing links ===\nThe access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site.  They do not, however, log which links visitors left by.  This is because the visitor\'s browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link.\n\nThis information can be captured in several ways.  One way involves URL redirection.  Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website\'s domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website\'s server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = Google revives redirect snoopery\n  | journal = blog.anta.net\n  | date = 2009-01-29\n  | url = http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | issn = 1797-1993\n  | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110817024348/http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | archivedate=2011-08-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.\n\n=== Short aliases for long URLs ===\n{{Main|URL shortening}}\n\nWeb applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of [[microblogging]] sites. [[URL shortening]] services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.\n\n=== Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ===\n{{See also|Permalink|PURL|Link rot}}\n\nSometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.\n\n=== Post/Redirect/Get ===\n{{Main|Post/Redirect/Get}}\n\nPost/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a [[web development]] [[design pattern]] that prevents some duplicate [[form (web)|form]] submissions, creating a more intuitive interface for [[user agent]]s (users).\n\n=== Manipulating search engines ===\nRedirect techniques are used to fool search engines.  For example, one page could show popular search terms to search engines but redirect the visitors to a different target page.  There are also cases where redirects have been used to "steal" the page rank of one popular page and use it for a different page, They will also redirect using searches with search engines as searches, usually involving the 302 [[List of HTTP status codes|HTTP status code]] of "moved temporarily."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandia.com/sw-2004/40-hijack.html |title=Google\'s serious hijack problem \xe2\x80\x93 Spammers hijack web site listings in Google |date=September 13, 2004 |publisher=Pandia.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130605153457/http://www.pandia.com/sw-2004/40-hijack.html |archivedate=2013-06-05}}</ref><ref>[http://www.loriswebs.com/hijacking_web_pages.html "Stop Scrapers From Hijacking your Web Pages"]. Lori\'s Web Design.com. Retrieved 2013-12-18.</ref>\n\nSearch engine providers have noticed the problem and are working on appropriate actions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nAs a result, today, such manipulations usually result in less rather than more site exposure.\n\n=== Manipulating visitors ===\nURL redirection is sometimes used as a part of [[phishing]] attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and, ironically, installing a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] of some sort instead.\n\n=== Removing <code>referer</code> information ===\nWhen a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the [[HTTP request]] a field called [[HTTP referer|referer]] which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the [[server log|logs]] of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, <code><nowiki>http://company.com/plans-for-the-next-release-of-our-product</nowiki></code>), it is not desirable for the <code>referer</code> URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs [[Referer#Referrer hiding|referrer hiding]] could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example <code><nowiki>http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code> into <code><nowiki>http://redirect.company.com/http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code>. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referer URL, such as the [[session ID]], and can reduce the chance of [[phishing]] by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.\n\n== Techniques ==\nSeveral different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection.  These vary in whether they affect [[HTTP headers]] or HTML content.  The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system.  For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a [[meta refresh|Refresh meta tag]] whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n=== Manual redirect ===\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\n<source lang="html4strict">\nPlease follow <a href="http://www.example.com/">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n=== HTTP status codes 3xx ===\nIn the [[HTTP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by the [[World Wide Web]], a \'\'\'redirect\'\'\' is a response with a [[List of HTTP status codes|status code]] beginning with \'\'3\'\' that causes a browser to display a different page.  The different codes describe the reason for the redirect, which allows for the correct subsequent action (such as changing links in the case of code 301, a permanent change of address).\n\nHTTP/1.1 defines [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4 several status codes] for redirection:\n* [[HTTP 300|300 multiple choices]] (e.g. offer different languages)\n* [[HTTP 301|301 moved permanently]]\n* [[HTTP 302|302 found]] (originally "temporary redirect" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n* [[HTTP 303|303 see other]] (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n* [[HTTP 307|307 temporary redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n\nAll of these status codes require that the URL of the redirect target be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response.  The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n(Status codes [[HTTP 304|304 not modified]] and [[HTTP 305|305 use proxy]] are not redirects).\n\nAn [[HTTP]] response with the 301 "moved permanently" redirect looks like this:\n\n<source lang="html4strict">\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://www.example.org/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 174\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Moved</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Moved</h1>\n<p>This page has moved to <a href="http://www.example.org/">http://www.example.org/</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n==== Using server-side scripting for redirection ====\nWeb authors producing HTML content can\'t usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling "non-parsed-headers").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a "Location:" header line.  For example, in [[PHP]], one can use the "header" function:\n\n<source lang="php">\nheader(\'HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\');\nheader(\'Location: http://www.example.com/\');\nexit();\n</source>\n\n(More headers may be required to prevent caching<ref name="php-301-robust-solution">{{cite web|url=http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution/ |title=PHP Redirects: 302 to 301 Rock Solid Robust Solution |publisher=WebSiteFactors.co.uk |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121012042703/http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution |archivedate=2012-10-12}}</ref>).\n\nThe programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the [[Active Server Pages|ASP scripting]] language, this can also be accomplished using <code>response.buffer=true</code> and <code>response.redirect <nowiki>"http://www.example.com/"</nowiki></code>\n\nHTTP/1.1 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2 allows for] either a relative URI reference or an absolute URI reference. If the URI reference is relative the client computes the required absolute URI reference according to [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5 the rules defined in RFC 3986].\n\n==== Apache mod_rewrite ====\nThe [[Apache HTTP Server]]\'s [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_alias.html mod_alias] extension can be used to redirect certain requests.  Typical configuration directives look like:\n\n<source lang="apache">\nRedirect permanent /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\nRedirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\n</source>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor more flexible URL rewriting and redirection, Apache [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html mod_rewrite] can be used.  E.g. to redirect a requests to a canonical domain name:\n<source lang="apache">\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.:]+\\.)*oldsite\\.example\\.com\\.?(:[0-9]*)?$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://newsite.example.net/$1 [R=301,L]\n</source>\n\nSuch configuration can be applied to one or all sites on the server through the server configuration files or to a single content directory through a <code>.htaccess</code> file.\n\n==== nginx rewrite ====\n[[Nginx]] has an integrated http rewrite module,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nginx.org/r/rewrite |title=Module ngx_http_rewrite_module - rewrite |publisher=nginx.org |date= |accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> which can be used to perform advanced URL processing and even web-page generation (with the <tt>return</tt> directive).  A showing example of such advanced use of the rewrite module is [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su], which implements a deterministic [[URL shortening]] service entirely with the help of nginx configuration language alone.<ref>{{cite mailing list |date=18 February 2013 |url=http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2013-February/037592.html |mailinglist=nginx@nginx.org |title=A dynamic web-site written wholly in nginx.conf?

This can specify a new URL to replace one page with another.  This is supported by most web browsers.  See\n* [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp HTML <meta> tag]\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20020802170847/http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html An exploration of dynamic documents]\n\nA timeout of zero seconds effects an immediate redirect. This is treated like a 301 permanent redirect by Google, allowing transfer of PageRank to the target page.<ref>[http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/ "Google and Yahoo accept undelayed meta refreshs as 301 redirects"]. Sebastian\'s Pamphlets. 3 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThis is an example of a simple HTML document that uses this technique:\n<source lang="html4strict">\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://www.example.com/" />\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>Please follow <a href="http://www.example.com/">this link</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThis technique can be used by [[Web designer|web authors]] because the meta tag is contained inside the document itself.  The meta tag must be placed in the "head" section of the HTML file.  The number "0" in this example may be replaced by another number to achieve a delay of that many seconds.  The anchor in the "body" section is for users whose browsers do not support this feature.\n\nThe same effect can be achieved with an HTTP <code>refresh</code> header:\n<source lang="html4strict">\nHTTP/1.1 200 ok\nRefresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\nContent-type: text/html\nContent-length: 78\n\nPlease follow <a href="http://www.example.com/">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis response is easier to generate by CGI programs because one does not need to change the default status code.\n\nHere is a simple CGI program that effects this redirect:\n<source lang="perl">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint "Refresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\\r\\n";\nprint "Content-type: text/html\\r\\n";\nprint "\\r\\n";\nprint "Please follow <a href=\\"http://www.example.com/\\">this link</a>!"\n</source>\n\nNote: Usually, the HTTP server adds the status line and the Content-length header automatically.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] discourage the use of meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or [[search engine]]). The W3C\'s [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-no-periodic-refresh Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4)] discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate.  Some articles that they have written on the issue include [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-movement W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes], [http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback Use standard redirects: don\'t break the back button!] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#auto-page-refresh Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 section 7].\n\n=== JavaScript redirects ===\n[[JavaScript]] can cause a redirect by setting the <code>window.location</code> attribute, e.g.:\n<syntaxhighlight lang="ecmascript">\nwindow.location=\'http://www.example.com/\'\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNormally JavaScript pushes the redirector site\'s [[URL]] to the browser\'s history. It can cause redirect loops when users hit the back button. With the following command you can prevent this type of behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online-marketing-technologies.com/tools/javascript-redirection-generator.html|title=Advanced JavaScript Redirections|publisher=Online Marketing Technologies}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang="ecmascript">\nwindow.location.replace(\'http://www.example.com/\')\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHowever, HTTP headers or the refresh meta tag may be preferred for security reasons and because JavaScript will not be executed by some browsers and many [[web crawler]]s.\n\n=== Frame redirects ===\nA slightly different effect can be achieved by creating a single HTML [[Iframe|frame]] that contains the target page:\n<source lang="html4strict">\n<frameset rows="100%">\n  <frame src="http://www.example.com/">\n  <noframes>\n    <body>Please follow <a href="http://www.example.com/">link</a>.</body>\n  </noframes>\n</frameset>\n</source>\n\nOne main difference to the above redirect methods is that for a frame redirect, the browser displays the URL of the frame document and not the URL of the target page in the URL bar.\n\nThis \'\'cloaking\'\' technique may be used so that the reader sees a more memorable URL or to fraudulently conceal a [[phishing]] site as part of [[website spoofing]].<ref>Aaron Emigh (19 January 2005). [http://www.sfbay-infragard.org/Documents/phishing-sfectf-report.pdf "Anti-Phishing Technology"] (PDF). Radix Labs.</ref>\n\nThe same effect can be done with an inline frame:\n<source lang="html4strict">\n<iframe height="100%" width="100%" src="http://www.example.com/">\nPlease follow <a href="http://www.example.com/">link</a>.\n</iframe>\n</source>\n\n=== Redirect chains ===\nOne redirect may lead to another. For example, the URL [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/URL_redirection http://www.wikipedia\'\'\'.com\'\'\'/wiki/URL_redirection] (note the domain name) is first redirected to [[:www:URL redirection|http://www.wikipedia\'\'\'.org\'\'\'/wiki/URL redirection]] and then to the correct URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection. This is unavoidable if the different links in the chain are served by different servers though it should be minimised by \'\'rewriting\'\' the URL as much as possible on the server before returning it to the browser as a redirect.\n\n=== Redirect loops ===\nSometimes a mistake can cause a page to end up redirecting back to itself, possibly via other pages, leading to an infinite sequence of redirects. Browsers should stop redirecting after a certain number of hops and display an error message.\n\n[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4 HTTP/1.1] states:\n<blockquote>\nA client \'\'SHOULD\'\' detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e., "infinite" redirection loops).\n\nNote: An earlier version of this specification recommended a maximum of five redirections ([RFC2068], Section 10.3).  Content developers need to be aware that some clients might implement such a fixed limitation.\n</blockquote>\nNote that the URLs in the sequence might not repeat, e.g.: http://www.example.com/1 -> http://www.example.com/2 -> http://www.example.com/3 ...\n\n== Services ==\nThere exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.\n\n=== URL redirection services ===\nA \'\'\'redirect service\'\'\' is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the [[Domain Name System]].\n\nHyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\n\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using [[AJAX]] as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs.\n\nA major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n==== History ====\nThe first redirect services took advantage of [[top-level domains]] (TLD) such as "[[.to]]" (Tonga), "[[.at]]" (Austria) and "[[.is]]" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including "r.im", "go.to", "i.am", "come.to" and "start.at".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net gains for tiny Pacific nation | date=2007-09-14 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref> As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $70.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined.\n\nWith the launch of [[TinyURL]] in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely [[URL shortening]]. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular [[Twitter]] service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n=== Referrer masking ===\nRedirection services can hide the [[referrer]] by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.)\n\nThis type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a [[session ID]] in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective [[phishing]]  .\n\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in [[PHP]].\n<source lang="php">\n<?php\n$url = htmlspecialchars($_GET[\'url\']);\nheader( \'Refresh: 0; url=http://\'.$url );\n?>\n<!-- Fallback using meta refresh. -->\n<html>\n <head>\n  <title>Redirecting...</title>\n  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=http://<?php echo $url; ?>">\n </head>\n <body>\n Attempting to redirect to <a href="http://<?php echo $url; ?>">http://<?php echo $url; ?></a>.\n </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the url provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a url parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server\'s resources.\n\n==Security Issues==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for [[Phishing]] attacks, such as [[Open Redirect]] and [[Covert Redirect]].\n\n"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation."<ref name="Open_Redirect">{{cite web | url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect | title=Open Redirect |publisher= OWASP |date=16 March 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n"Covert Redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation."<ref name="Covert_Redirect">{{cite web | url=http://tetraph.com/covert_redirect/ | title=Covert Redirect |publisher= Tetraph |date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> It is disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.<ref name="CNET">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-and-openid-discovered/ | title=Serious security flaw in OAuth, OpenID discovered |publisher= CNET |date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Link rot]]\n* [[Canonical meta tag]]\n* [[Domain masking]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations]\n* [http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/paper/www07.pdf Paper on redirection spam (UC Davis)] (403 Forbidden link)\n* [http://projects.webappsec.org/URL-Redirector-Abuse Security vulnerabilities in URL Redirectors] The Web Application Security Consortium Threat Classification\n* [http://www.dancatts.com/articles/htaccess-301-redirects-for-moved-pages.php 301 Redirects for moved pages using .htaccess]\n* [http://911-need-code-help.blogspot.com/2011/03/redirecting-visitors-to-preferred.html Redirecting your visitors to your preferred domain] using 301 permanent redirects&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 rationale and mod_rewrite/PHP/ASP.NET implementations\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Url Redirection}}\n[[Category:Uniform resource locator]]\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]'

The company is headquartered in [[McLean, Virginia]] and in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. ZyLAB\xe2\x80\x99s most important products are ZyLAB eDiscovery & Production System, the ZyLAB Information Management Platform and bundles that build systems for deployments.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1983 ZyLAB was the first company providing a [[Full text search|full-text]] search program for electronic files stored in the file system of [[IBM PC compatible|IBM-compatible PCs]]. The program was called ZyINDEX. The first version of ZyINDEX was written in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and worked on [[MS-DOS]]. Subsequent programs were written in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and work on a variety of Microsoft operating systems.\n\nIn 1991, ZyLAB integrated ZyINDEX with an optical character recognition ([[Optical character recognition|OCR]]) program, Calera Wordscan, which was a spin-off from [[Raymond Kurzweil]]\xe2\x80\x99s first OCR implementation. This integration was called ZyIMAGE. ZyIMAGE was the first PC program to include a [[Fuzzy string searching|fuzzy string search]] algorithm to overcome scanning and OCR errors.\n\nIn 1998, the company developed support to full-text search email, including attachments.\n\nIn 2000, ZyLAB embraced the new [[XML]] standard and created a full content management and records management system based on the XML standard and build a full solution for e-discovery, historical archives, records management, document management, email archiving, contract management, and professional back-office solutions.\n\nIn 2003, the company invested in expanding the ZyIMAGE product suite with advanced [[text analytics]], [[text mining]], [[data visualization]], [[computational linguistics]], and [[Machine translation|automatic translation]].\n\n2005: ZyIMAGE Information Access Platform was released, an integrated solution to address information access problems.\n\nPlatforms for ZyIMAGE e-Discovery and legal production, historical archiving, compliance, back-office records management and [[COMINT#COMINT|COMINT]] were launched in 2007.\n\n2010: ZyLAB Information Management Platform was released, an integrated solution to address e-Discovery and information management problems.\n\n==Customers==\nInitial customers of ZyINDEX were organizations such as the [[FBI]] and other law enforcement agencies to investigate electronic data from seized PCs, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for on-board manuals, and law firms around the world for [[Electronic discovery|e-Discovery]]. Over the years, ZyLAB received grants from the European Union (DG13).\n\nOther well-known ZyLAB customers were [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson\'s defense team]], war crime tribunals such as the [[trial of Slobodan Milo\xc5\xa1evi\xc4\x87]], the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia|UN-AKRT-ECCC Cambodia Khmer Rouge trials]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|Rwanda tribunal]]. In 2007, the U.S. [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] selected ZyLAB for email archiving, basically for its open XML structures, which is endorsed by organizations such as the [[National Archives and Records Administration]]. ZyLAB\xe2\x80\x99s software was used for many other high-profile investigations such as the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].\n\nPublic websites also use the ZyLAB Webserver.\n\n[[Gartner]] positioned ZyLAB in the "Leaders" quadrant in its 2007, 2008 and 2009 Magic Quadrant for Information Access Solutions, gave it a strong positive rating in its 2007, 2008 and 2009 e-Discovery Marketscope and a Positive Rating in its 2007 and 2008 Records Management MarketScope.\n\nZyLAB\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategy officer, Dr. Johannes C. Scholtes, is professor in [[text mining]] at [[Maastricht University|the University of Maastricht]] faculty of Humanities and Sciences and director in the board of AIIM.\n\n==System overview and compatibility==\nAccording to the company\xe2\x80\x99s website it delivers systems for deployments, product bundles and the core components is the ZyLAB Information Management platform include:\n\nSystems:\n*ZyLAB eDiscovery and Production\n*ZyLAB Compliance and Litigation readiness\n*ZyLAB Law Enforcement and Investigations\n*ZyLAB Communications Intelligence\n*ZyLAB Digital Print and Media Archiving\n*ZyLAB Enterprise Information Management\n\nBundles:\n*E-Mail Archiving Bundle\n*Microsoft SharePoint Bundle\n*Analytics Bundle\n*eDiscovery EDRM Processing bundle\n*DoD and Sox Compliant RMA Bundle\n*TIFF Archiving and Production Bundle\n*WebPublishing Bundle\n*Commercial Publishing Bundle\n*Business Process Automation Bundle\n*Development and Integrators Bundle\n*Scanning Bundle\n*Digital Copier Bundle\n*Professional Text Mining\n*Machine translation\n\n===Supported configurations===\n*\'\'\'Server OS\'\'\': Windows 2003, Windows 2008\n*\'\'\'Databases\'\'\': XML, MS SQL Server 2005, MS SQL Server 2008, Oracle 10g, Oracle 11g, mySQL\n*\'\'\'Web Servers\'\'\': IIS\n*\'\'\'Client OS\'\'\': Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7\n*\'\'\'Clustering\'\'\': Support for Active/Passive Failover.\n*\'\'\'Authentication\'\'\': Active Directory, LDAP, XML, NTFS, IBM Tripoli.\n*\'\'\'Virtualization\'\'\': VMware Infrastructure, VMware Workstation, VMware Server, VMware Fusion.\n\n===Languages supported===\n*\'\'\'Unicode\'\'\'.

In addition to these languages, over 400 languages are supported by ZyLAB\'s recognition and full-text indexing technology, including all Western-European, Eastern European, Baltic, African, Asian and South American languages. ZyLAB\'s technical ability for broad language and character recognition enhances the accuracy of stored information searches and helps diminish the costs incurred by incorrect searches or text correction.\n\n==Zy-IMAGE-nation Annual Conference==\nThe annual Zy-IMAGE-nation Conference is sponsored by ZyLAB. During this conference, seminars and interactive sessions from leading professionals about the advanced technologies and procedural enhancements that are driving new levels of operational efficiency in private and public sectors. The focus of the conference is on technologies that provide integrated capabilities for managing the accumulated knowledge of an organization, especially records and e-mail, as well as other business-critical processes. Related topics to be covered include best practices for e-discovery preparation and implementation, records management, email archiving, and knowledge management.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic discovery|e-Discovery]]\n* [[Optical character recognition|Optical Character Recognition (OCR)]]\n* [[Document Imaging]]\n* [[E-mail archiving|E-mail Archiving]]\n* [[Knowledge Management]]\n* [[Document management system|Document Management (System)]]\n* [[Enterprise content management|Enterprise Content Management]]\n* [[Records management|Records Management]]\n* [[Contract management|Contract Management]]\n* [[Workflow]]\n* [[Text mining|Text Mining]]\n* [[Text analytics|Text Analytics]]\n* [[Machine translation|Automatic Machine Translation]]\n* [[Data visualization|Data Visualization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,,t=zyindex&i=55248,00.asp Definition of ZyINDEX] in [[PC Magazine|\'\'PCMAG.com\'\']]\'s encyclopedia\n*[http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ZyIMAGE&i=55247,00.asp Definition of ZyIMAGE] in [[PC Magazine|\'\'PCMAG.com\'\']]\'s encyclopedia\n*[http://www.informationweek.com/777/knowledge.htm Review] of ZyImage 3.0 in \'\'[[InformationWeek]]\'\'\n*[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9201794_ITM Mac version of ZyINDEX made its debut on Comdex]\n*[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DA1730F93AA35751C0A96E948260 Review] of ZyINDEX in the \'\'[[New York Times]]\'\'\n*[http://www.computerwoche.de/heftarchiv/1988/26/1155611/ Review] of ZyINDEX on \'\'Computerwoche.de\'\' (article in German)\n*[http://www.computerwoche.de/index.cfm?pid=2123&pk=1096333 Review] of ZyIMAGE\'s webserver on \'\'Computerwoche.de\'\' (article in German)\n*[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB367D56736E685&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date: Review] of ZyINDEX in the \'\'[[Miami Herald]]\'\'\n*[http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/0203/chapter3.htm ZyINDEX used in the Investigation of the Belated Production of Documents in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case]\n*[http://www.fcw.com/print/6_31/news/70014-1.html Review] of ZyIMAGE on \'\'Federal Computer Week (FCW.com)\'\'\n*Zylab retrieval engine optimized for CD-ROM;

In 2010, Twitter introduced "[[Twitter#Trending_topics|Trending Topics]]" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to [[spamming|spam]] the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/the-secret-of-twitters-trending-hashtags-with-insight-and-tips/ |title=The Secret of Twitter\'s Trending Hashtags With Insight and Tips |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\nOn microblogging or social networking sites, hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a sentence, either preceding it, following it as a [[postscript]], or being included as a word within the sentence (e.g. "It is #sunny today").\n\nThe quantity of hashtags used in a post or tweet is just as important as the type of hashtags used. It is currently considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the "absolute maximum", and any contribution exceeding this risks \xe2\x80\x9craising the ire of the community.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a (#) Hashtag?|url=http://www.hashtags.org/how-to/history/what-is-a-hashtag/|publisher=Hashtags.org|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation, could cause an account to be filtered from search, or even suspended.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Twitter Rules|url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/56-policies-violations/topics/236-twitter-rules-policies/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2014}}\n \n[[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] performed a sketch parodying the often misused and misunderstood usage of hashtags on \'\'[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]\'\' in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA |title="#Hashtag" with Jimmy Fallon & Justin Timberlake (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon) |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\n[[File:Seguir hashtags.png|300px|right|thumb|Search bar in the header of a social networking site, searching for most recent posts containing the hashtag "#science".]]\nHashtags are mostly used as unmoderated ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can "trend" and attract more individual users to discussion using the hashtag. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the "Trending Topics" area of a user\'s homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users, and neither can they be "retired" from public usage, meaning that hashtags can be used in theoretical perpetuity depending upon the longevity of the word or set of characters in a written language. They also do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes as espoused by those who make use of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using "#cakefestival" rather than simply "#cake". However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become "trending topics" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic.  In order for topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and "follow" (subscribe) or "list" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting pictures and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic like #photography #iPhone #iphoneography and therefore do not fulfil a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = 7 November 2013|publisher=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref> The censorship and ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular subaltern communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram\xe2\x80\x99s content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.<ref>\nOlszanowski, M. (2014).

This can help express humor, excitement, sadness or other contextual cues, for example "It\'s Monday!! #excited #sarcasm"\n\n==Use outside of social networking websites==\nThe feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on [[YouTube]] and [[Gawker Media]]; in the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments are used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees are not logged into the website.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://gawker.com/5382267/anarchy-in-the-machine-welcome-to-gawkers-open-forums|title = Anarchy in the Machine: Welcome to Gawker\'s Open Forums|author = Gabriel Snyder|publisher = Gawker|date = Oct 15, 2009<!-- 3:25 PM-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/10/got-a-tip-gawker-media-opens-tag-pages-to-masses-expecting-chaos/|title = Got a #tip?

Broadcasters also make use of such a style in order to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter\'s director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. [[It\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, "temporary" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter\'s Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|publisher = Fast Company}}</ref> Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2013-03-22 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded "[[Index term|keywords]]" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of commercials and series episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords \xe2\x80\x94 But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}</ref>\n\n===Purchasing===\n\nSince February 2013 there is a collaboration between the social networking site Twitter and [[American Express]] that makes it possible to buy discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.<ref>{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = 12 February 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = 2013-11-25}}</ref> American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and use the offers by tweeting and look for a response in a tweet with the confirmation from American Express.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter|publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref>\n\n===Event promotion===\n\n[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights]]\nOrganized real-world events have also made use of hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants in order to find each other on both Twitter and, in many cases, in real life during events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion.\n\n===Consumer complaints===\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms in order to complain about the customer service experience with large companies.  The term "bashtag" has been created to describe situations in which a corporate social media hashtag is used to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald\'s]] created the #McDStories hashtag so customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. The marketing effort was cancelled after just two hours when McDonald\'s received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were expecting.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = 17 May 2012 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===Sentiment analysis===\nThe use of hashtags also reveals things about the sentiment an author attaches to a statement.

S'\'\'\'Information need\'\'\' is an individual or group\'s desire to locate and obtain [[information]] to satisfy a conscious or unconscious [[need]]. The \xe2\x80\x98information\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98need\xe2\x80\x99 in \xe2\x80\x98information need\xe2\x80\x99 are an inseparable interconnection. Needs and interests call forth information. The objectives of studying information needs are:\n# The explanation of observed phenomena of information use or expressed need;\n# The prediction of instances of information uses;\n# The control and thereby improvement of the utilization of information manipulation of essentials conditions.\n\nInformation needs are related to, but distinct from [[information requirements]].  An example is that a need is hunger; the requirement is food.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe concept of information needs was coined by an American information gernalist [http://www.libsci.sc.edu/BOB/ISP/taylor2.htm Robert S. Taylor] in his article [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asi.5090130405 "The Process of Asking Questions"] published in American Documentation (Now is Journal of the American Society of Information Science and Technology).\n\nIn this paper, Taylor attempted to describe how an inquirer obtains an answer from an [[information system]], by performing the process consciously or unconsciously; also he studied the reciprocal influence between the inquirer and a given system.\n\nAccording to Taylor, information need has four levels:\n# The conscious and unconscious need for information not existing in the remembered experience of the investigator. In terms of the query range, this level might be called the \xe2\x80\x9cideal question\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the question which would bring from the ideal system exactly what the inquirer, if he could state his need. It is the actual, but unexpressed, need for information\n# The conscious mental description of an ill-defined area of in decision. In this level, the inquirer might talk to someone else in the field to get an answer.\n# A researcher forms a rational statement of his question. This statement is a rational and unambiguous description of the inquirer\xe2\x80\x99s doubts.\n# The question as presented to the information system.\n\nThere are variables within a system that influence the question and its formation. Taylor divided them into five groups: general aspects (physical and geographical factors); system input (What type of material is put into the system, and what is the unit item?); internal organization (classification, indexing, subject heading, and similar access schemes); question input (what part do human operators play in the total system?); output (interim feedback).\n\nHerbert Menzel preferred demand studies to preference studies. Requests for information or documents that were actually made by scientists in the course of their activities form the data for demand studies. Data may be in the form of records of orders placed for bibliographics, calls for books from an interlibrary loan system, or inquires addressed to an information center or service. Menzel also investigated user study and defined information seeking behaviour from three angles:\n# When approached from the point of view of the scientist or technologists, these are studies of scientists\xe2\x80\x99 communication behaviour;\n# When approached from the point of view of any communication medium, they are use studies;\n# When approached from the science communication system, they are studies in the flow of information among scientists and technologists.\n\nWilliam J. Paisley moved from information needs/uses toward strong guidelines for information system. He studied the theories of information-processing behavior that will generate propositions concerning channel selection; amount of seeking; effects on productivity of information quality, quantity, currency, and diversity; the role of motivational and personality factors, etc. He investigated a concentric conceptual framework for user research. In the framework, he places the information users at the centre of ten systems, which are:\n# The scientist within his culture.\n# The scientist within a political system.\n# The scientist within a membership group.\n# The scientist within a reference group.\n# The scientist within an invisible college.\n# The scientist within a formal organization.\n# The scientist within a work team.\n# The scientist within his own head.\n# The scientist within a legal/economical system.\n# The scientist within a formal.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n\n==References==\n* Menzel, Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cInformation Needs and Uses in Science and Technology.\xe2\x80\x9d Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, Vol. 1, Interscience Publishers 1966, pp 41-69.\n* Paisley, William J. \xe2\x80\x9cInformation Needs and Uses.\xe2\x80\x9d Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, Vol.3, Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica, Inc.

S"{{multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=March 2008}}\n}}\n\n== IR Evaluation ==\nThe evaluation of information retrieval system is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for [[Standard Boolean model|Boolean retrieval]] or top-k retrieval, include [[precision and recall]].\n\n*'''Precision''' is the fraction of retrieved documents that are [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevant]] to the query:\n\n:<math> \\mbox{precision}=\\frac{|\\{\\mbox{relevant documents}\\}\\cap\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|}{|\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|} </math>\n\n*'''Recall''' is the fraction of the documents relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved:\n\n:<math> \\mbox{recall}=\\frac{|\\{\\mbox{relevant documents}\\}\\cap\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|}{|\\{\\mbox{relevant documents}\\}|} </math>\n\n*'''F-measure''' is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\n:<math> \\mbox{F-measure}= 2 * \\frac{\\{\\mbox{precision}\\}*\\{\\mbox{recall}\\}}{\\{\\mbox{precision}\\}+\\{\\mbox{recall}\\}} </math>\n\nFor modern (Web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. [[Precision and recall#Precision|Precision]] at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 corresponds to the number of relevant results on the first search results page), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k.\n\nF-measure tends to be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall because both of them give different information that can complement each other when combined. If one of them excels more than the other, this metric will reflect it.\n\nVirtually all modern evaluation metrics (e.g., [[Information retrieval#Mean average precision|mean average precision]], [[Information retrieval#Discounted cumulative gain|discounted cumulative gain]]) are designed for '''ranked retrieval''' without any explicit rank cutoff, taking into account the relative order of the documents retrieved by the search engines and giving more weight to documents returned at higher ranks.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[Precision and recall]]\n* [[Web search engine]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Christopher D.

One historical snapshot of the list in 1992 remains,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html |title=World-Wide Web Servers |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> but as more and more webservers went online the central list could no longer keep up. On the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]]  site, new servers were announced under the title "What\'s New!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.mcom.com/home/whatsnew/whats_new_0294.html |title=What\'s New! February 1994 |publisher=Home.mcom.com |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe first tool used for searching on the [[Internet]] was [[Archie search engine|Archie]].<ref name=LeidenUnivSE>\n     "Internet History - Search Engines" (from [[Search Engine Watch]]),\n     Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands, September 2001, web:\n     [http://www.internethistory.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?c=7 LeidenU-Archie].\n</ref>\nThe name stands for "archive" without the "v".  It was created in 1990 by [[Alan Emtage]], Bill Heelan and J. Peter Deutsch, computer science students at [[McGill University]]  in [[Montreal]]. The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP ([[File Transfer Protocol]]) sites, creating a searchable database of file names; however, Archie did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually.\n\nThe rise of [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] (created in 1991 by [[Mark McCahill]]  at the [[University of Minnesota]]) led to two new search programs, [[Veronica (computer)|Veronica]]  and [[Jughead (computer)|Jughead]]. Like Archie, they searched the file names and titles stored in Gopher index systems. Veronica (\'\'V\'\'ery \'\'E\'\'asy \'\'R\'\'odent-\'\'O\'\'riented \'\'N\'\'et-wide \'\'I\'\'ndex to \'\'C\'\'omputerized \'\'A\'\'rchives) provided a keyword search of most Gopher menu titles in the entire Gopher listings. Jughead (\'\'J\'\'onzy\'s \'\'U\'\'niversal \'\'G\'\'opher \'\'H\'\'ierarchy \'\'E\'\'xcavation \'\'A\'\'nd \'\'D\'\'isplay) was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher servers.  While the name of the search engine "Archie" was not a reference to the [[Archie Comics|Archie comic book]] series, "[[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]]" and "[[Jughead Jones|Jughead]]" are characters in the series, thus referencing their predecessor.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, no search engine existed for the web, though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by hand. [[Oscar Nierstrasz]] at the [[University of Geneva]] wrote a series of [[Perl]] scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format. This formed the basis for [[W3Catalog]], the web\'s first primitive search engine, released on September 2, 1993.<ref name="Announcement html">{{cite web |url= http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www/browse_thread/thread/2176526a36dc8bd3/2718fd17812937ac?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=Oscar+Nierstrasz#2718fd17812937ac|title=Searchable Catalog of WWW Resources (experimental)|author=[[Oscar Nierstrasz]]|date=2 September 1993}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1993, Matthew Gray, then at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], produced what was probably the first [[web robot]], the [[Perl]]-based [[World Wide Web Wanderer]], and used it to generate an index called \'Wandex\'.  The purpose of the Wanderer was to measure the size of the World Wide Web, which it did until late 1995.  The web\'s second search engine [[Aliweb]] appeared in November 1993.  Aliweb did not use a [[web robot]], but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format.\n\n[[JumpStation]] (created in December 1993<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-1293.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20010620073530/http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-1293.html |archivedate=2001-06-20 |title=Archive of NCSA what\'s new in December 1993 page |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-06-20 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> by [[Jonathon Fletcher]]) used a [[web crawler|web robot]] to find web pages and to build its index, and used a [[web form]] as the interface to its query program.  It was thus the first WWW resource-discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine (crawling, indexing, and searching) as described below.  Because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on, its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered.\n\nOne of the first "all text" crawler-based search engines was [[WebCrawler]], which came out in 1994.  Unlike its predecessors, it allowed users to search for any word in any webpage, which has become the standard for all major search engines since. It was also the first one widely known by the public.  Also in 1994, [[Lycos]] (which started at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) was launched and became a major commercial endeavor.\n\nSoon after, many search engines appeared and vied for popularity. These included [[Magellan (search engine)|Magellan]], [[Excite]], [[Infoseek]], [[Inktomi (company)|Inktomi]], [[Northern Light Group|Northern Light]], and [[AltaVista]]. [[Yahoo!]] was among the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest, but its search function operated on its [[web directory]], rather than its full-text copies of web pages. Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword-based search.\n\nGoogle adopted the idea of selling search terms in 1998, from a small search engine company named [[goto.com]]. This move had a significant effect on the SE business, which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the internet.<ref>http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012/Unit/616074/Nugget/671097</ref>\n\nIn 1996, [[Netscape]] was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on Netscape\'s web browser. There was so much interest that instead Netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines: for $5 million a year, each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine page.  The five engines were Yahoo!, Magellan, Lycos, Infoseek, and Excite.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yahoo!

Some have taken down their public search engine, and are marketing enterprise-only editions, such as Northern Light. Many search engine companies were caught up in the [[dot-com bubble]], a speculation-driven market boom that peaked in 1999 and ended in 2001.\n\nAround 2000, [[Google Search|Google\'s search engine]] rose to prominence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/about/company/history/ |title=Our History in depth |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref>  The company achieved better results for many searches with an innovation called [[PageRank]], as was explained in the paper \'\'Anatomy of a Search Engine\'\' written by [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Larry Page]], the later founders of Google.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/1/1998-8.pdf|title=The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|last2=Page|first2=Larry}}</ref> This [[iterative algorithm]] ranks web pages based on the number and PageRank of other web sites and pages that link there, on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others. Google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine. In contrast, many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a [[web portal]]. In fact, Google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as [[Mystery Seeker]].\n\nBy 2000, [[Yahoo!]] was providing search services based on Inktomi\'s search engine. Yahoo! acquired Inktomi in 2002, and [[Overture]] (which owned [[AlltheWeb]] and AltaVista) in 2003.  Yahoo! switched to Google\'s search engine until 2004, when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions.\n\n[[Microsoft]] first launched MSN Search in the fall of 1998 using search results from Inktomi.  In early 1999 the site began to display listings from [[Looksmart]], blended with results from Inktomi. For a short time in 1999, MSN Search used results from AltaVista were instead.  In 2004, [[Microsoft]] began a transition to its own search technology, powered by its own [[web crawler]] (called [[msnbot]]).\n\nMicrosoft\'s rebranded search engine, [[Bing]], was launched on June 1, 2009.  On July 29, 2009, Yahoo! and Microsoft finalized a deal in which [[Yahoo! Search]] would be powered by Microsoft Bing technology.\n\n== How web search engines work ==\n{{Original research|section|date=October 2013\n}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}\nA search engine operates in the following order:\n# [[Web crawling]]\n# [[Index (search engine)|Indexing]]\n# [[Web search query|Searching]]<ref name=Jawadekar2011>{{citation |year=2011 |author=Jawadekar, Waman S |title=Knowledge Management: Text & Cases |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XmGx4J9daUMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=knowledge+management:+text&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ou6uUP-cNqWTiAe2oICoAw&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA |chapter=8.

These pages are retrieved by a [[Web crawler]] (sometimes also known as a spider) \xe2\x80\x94 an automated Web crawler which follows every link on the site. The site owner can exclude specific pages by using [[robots.txt]].\n\nThe search engine then analyzes the contents of each page to determine how it should be [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] (for example, words can be extracted from the titles, page content, headings, or special fields called [[meta tags]]). Data about web pages are stored in an index database for use in later queries. A query from a user can be a single word. The index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> Some search engines, such as [[Google]], store all or part of the source page (referred to as a [[web cache|cache]]) as well as information about the web pages, whereas others, such as [[AltaVista]], store every word of every page they find.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} This cached page always holds the actual search text since it is the one that was actually indexed, so it can be very useful when the content of the current page has been updated and the search terms are no longer in it.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> This problem might be considered a mild form of [[linkrot]], and Google\'s handling of it increases [[usability]] by satisfying [[user expectations]] that the search terms will be on the returned webpage. This satisfies the [[principle of least astonishment]], since the user normally expects that the search terms will be on the returned pages. Increased search relevance makes these cached pages very useful as they may contain data that may no longer be available elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:WebCrawlerArchitecture.svg|thumb|High-level architecture of a standard Web crawler]]\nWhen a user enters a [[web search query|query]] into a search engine (typically by using [[Keyword (Internet search)|keywords]]), the engine examines its [[inverted index|index]] and provides a listing of best-matching web pages according to its criteria, usually with a short summary containing the document\'s title and sometimes parts of the text. The index is built from the information stored with the data and the method by which the information is indexed.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> From 2007 the Google.com search engine has allowed one to search by date by clicking "Show search tools" in the leftmost column of the initial search results page, and then selecting the desired date range.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Most search engines support the use of the [[boolean operators]] AND, OR and NOT to further specify the [[web search query|search query]]. Boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search. The engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered.  Some search engines provide an advanced feature called [[Proximity search (text)|proximity search]], which allows users to define the distance between keywords.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/>  There is also concept-based searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for. As well, natural language queries allow the user to type a question in the same form one would ask it to a human. A site like this would be ask.com.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe usefulness of a search engine depends on the [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] of the \'\'\'result set\'\'\' it gives back. While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. Most search engines employ methods to [[rank order|rank]] the results to provide the "best" results first. How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches, and what order the results should be shown in, varies widely from one engine to another.<ref name=Jawadekar2011/> The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve.  There are two main types of search engine that have evolved: one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively. The other is a system that generates an "[[inverted index]]" by analyzing texts it locates. This first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work.\n\nMost Web search engines are commercial ventures supported by [[advertising]] revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to [[paid inclusion|have their listings ranked higher]] in search results for a fee. Search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running [[contextual advertising|search related ads]] alongside the regular search engine results. The search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.rankstar.de/hilfe.html|publisher=RankStar|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Market share ==\n\n[[Google Search|Google]] is the world\'s most popular search engine, with a marketshare of 66.44 percent as of December, 2014.<ref name="NMS">{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&qpcustomd=0&qpcustom=|title=Desktop Search Engine Market Share|publisher=NetMarketShare|accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> [[Baidu]] comes in at second place.<ref name="NMS" />\n\nThe world\'s most popular search engines are:<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&qpcustomd=0|publisher=NetMarketShare|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class="wikitable sortable"\n!

This leads to an effect that has been called a [[filter bubble]]. The term describes a phenomenon in which websites use [[algorithm]]s to selectively guess what information a user would like to see, based on information about the user (such as location, past click behaviour and search history). As a result, websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user\'s past viewpoint, effectively isolating the user in a bubble that tends to exclude contrary information. Prime examples are Google\'s personalized search results and [[Facebook]]\'s personalized news stream. According to [[Eli Pariser]], who coined the term, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. Pariser related an example in which one user searched Google for "BP" and got investment news about [[British Petroleum]] while another searcher got information about the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] and that the two search results pages were "strikingly different".<ref name=twsT43>{{cite news\n |first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore\n |title= The Filter Bubble\n |work= The Atlantic\n |quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone.

S'{{Other uses|Relevance}}\n\nIn [[information science]] and [[information retrieval]], \'\'\'relevance\'\'\' denotes how well a retrieved document or set of documents meets the [[information need]] of the user. Relevance may include concerns such as timeliness, authority or novelty of the result.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe concern with the problem of finding relevant information dates back at least to the first publication of scientific journals in the 17th century.\n\nThe formal study of relevance began in the 20th Century with the study of what would later be called [[bibliometrics]]. In the 1930s and 1940s, S. C. Bradford used the term "relevant" to characterize articles relevant to a subject (cf., [[Bradford\'s law]]). In the 1950s, the first information retrieval systems emerged, and researchers noted the retrieval of irrelevant articles as a significant concern. In 1958, B. C. Vickery made the concept of relevance explicit in an address at the International Conference on Scientific Information.<ref>Mizzaro, S. (1997). Relevance: The Whole History. Journal of the American Society for Information Science. 48, 810\xe2\x80\x90832.</ref>\n\nSince 1958, information scientists have explored and debated definitions of relevance. A particular focus of the debate was the distinction between "relevance to a subject" or "topical relevance" and "user relevance".\n\nRecently, Zhao and Callan (2010)<ref>Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Term Necessity Prediction, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2010). Toronto, Canada, 2010.</ref> showed a connection between the [[Binary Independence Model|relevance probability]] and the [[vocabulary mismatch]] problem in retrieval, which could lead to at least 50-300% gains in retrieval accuracy.<ref>Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Automatic term mismatch diagnosis for selective query expansion, SIGIR 2012.</ref>\n\n== Evaluation ==\n\nThe information retrieval community has emphasized the use of test collections and benchmark tasks to measure topical relevance, starting with the [[Cranfield Experiments]] of the early 1960s and culminating in the [[Text Retrieval Conference|TREC]] evaluations that continue to this day as the main evaluation framework for information retrieval research.\n\nIn order to evaluate how well an [[information retrieval]] system retrieved topically relevant results, the relevance of retrieved results must be quantified. In [[Cranfield Experiments|Cranfield]]-style evaluations, this typically involves assigning a \'\'relevance level\'\' to each retrieved result, a process known as \'\'relevance assessment\'\'. Relevance levels can be binary (indicating a result is relevant or that it is not relevant), or graded (indicating results have a varying degree of match between the topic of the result and the information need).   Once relevance levels have been assigned to the retrieved results, [[Information retrieval#Performance measures|information retrieval performance measures]] can be used to assess the quality of a retrieval system\'s output.\n\nIn contrast to this focus solely on topical relevance, the information science community has emphasized user studies that consider user relevance. These studies often focus on aspects of [[human-computer interaction]] (see also [[human-computer information retrieval]]).\n\n== Clustering and relevance ==\n\nThe [[cluster hypothesis]], proposed by [[C. J. van Rijsbergen]] in 1979, asserts that two documents that are similar to each other have a high likelihood of being relevant to the same information need. With respect to the embedding similarity space, the cluster hypothesis can be interpreted globally or locally.<ref name=diazthesis>F. Diaz, Autocorrelation and Regularization of Query-Based Retrieval Scores. PhD thesis, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, February 2008, Chapter 3.</ref>    The global interpretation assumes that there exist some fixed set of underlying topics derived from inter-document similarity. These global clusters or their representatives can then be used to relate relevance of two documents (e.g. two documents in the same cluster should both be relevant to the same request). Methods in this spirit include:\n* cluster-based information retrieval<ref name=croftcbir>W. B. Croft, \xe2\x80\x9cA model of cluster searching based on classification,\xe2\x80\x9d Information Systems, vol. 5, pp. 189\xe2\x80\x93195, 1980.</ref><ref name=griffithscbir>A. Griffiths, H. C.

M. Voorhees, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cluster hypothesis revisited,\xe2\x80\x9d in SIGIR \xe2\x80\x9985: Proceedings of the 8th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, (New York, NY, USA), pp. 188\xe2\x80\x93196, ACM Press, 1985.</ref>    focuses on the local relationships between documents. The local interpretation avoids having to model the number or size of clusters in the collection and allow relevance at multiple scales. Methods in this spirit include,\n* multiple cluster retrieval<ref name=griffithscbir/><ref name=voorheescbir/>\n* spreading activation<ref name=preece>S.

An alternative strategy would be to use journal [[impact factor]] to rank output and thus base relevance on expert evaluations. Other strategies, such as including diversity of the search results, may be used as well. The important thing to recognize is, however, that relevance is fundamentally a question of [[epistemology]], not [[psychology]]. (Peoples\' psychology reflects certain epistemological influences).\n\n==References==\n {{reflist}}\n\n==Additional reading==\n*Hj\xc3\xb8rland, B. (2010). The foundation of the concept of relevance.

S"The '''Topic-based Vector Space Model (TVSM)'''<ref>{{cite | url=http://www.kuropka.net/files/TVSM.pdf | title=Topic-based Vector Space Model | author=Dominik Kuropka | coauthors=Jorg Becker | year=2003}}</ref> (literature: [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/engbuchmid?isbn=0514&lng=eng&id=]) extends the [[vector space model]] of [[information retrieval]] by removing the constraint that the term-vectors be orthogonal. The assumption of orthogonal terms is incorrect regarding natural languages which causes problems with synonyms and strong related terms. This facilitates the use of stopword lists, stemming and thesaurus in TVSM.\nIn contrast to the [[generalized vector space model]] the TVSM does not depend on concurrence-based similarities between terms. \n\n==Definitions==\nThe basic premise of TVSM is the existence of a ''d'' dimensional space ''R'' with only positive axis intercepts, i.e. ''R in R<sup>+</sup>'' and ''d in N<sup>+</sup>''. Each dimension of ''R'' represents a fundamental topic. A term vector ''t'' has a specific weight for a certain ''R''. To calculate these weights assumptions are made taking into account the document contents. Ideally important terms will have a high weight and stopwords and irrelevants terms to the topic will have a low weight. The TVSM document model is obtained as a sum of term vectors representing terms in the document. The similarity between two documents ''Di'' and ''Dj'' is defined as the scalar product of document vectors.\n\n==Enhanced Topic-based Vector Space Model==\nThe enhancement of the Enhanced Topic-based Vector Space Model (eTVSM)<ref>{{cite | url= http://kuropka.net/files/HPI_Evaluation_of_eTVSM.pdf | author=Dominik Kuropka | coauthors=Artem Polyvyanyy | title=A Quantitative Evaluation of the Enhanced Topic-Based Vector Space Model | year=2007}}</ref> (literature: [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/engbuchmid?isbn=0514&lng=eng&id=]) is a proposal on how to derive term vectors from an [[Ontology_(information_science) | Ontology]].

S'\'\'\'Globrix\'\'\' was a UK [[real estate]] [[Web search engine|search engine]] that was launched in January 2008. It was launched as a joint venture with [[News International]], publishers of \'\'[[The Sunday Times]]\'\', \'\'[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]\'\', \'\'[[The Times]]\'\', \'\'[[The News of the World]]\'\' and \'\'[[Thelondonpaper]]\'\'.<ref>[http://www.nma.co.uk/news/news-international-invests-in-property-site-globrix/35492.article News International invests in property site, Globrix - NMA article]</ref>\n\n[[Estate agent]]s and [[letting agent]]s could list their properties for free. This competed with traditional paid-listings sites such as [[Rightmove]] (originally a joint venture between four of the UK\'s largest property agents, now a [[public limited company]]), [[Zoopla|Propertyfinder]] (also partly backed by News International) and [[Primelocation]] (owned by [[Daily Mail and General Trust]]). Unlike most property websites, Globrix directed users to agent websites rather than hosting the property details and capturing the lead on Globrix itself. Globrix gathered its property listings in three different ways; crawling agent websites, taking data feeds and by agents manually uploading via the Globrix extranet. Because Globrix was \'free to list\', Globrix was able to gain substantial market coverage and claimed to list more properties than any other UK property website. Unlike websites like [[Gumtree]] and [[Oodle]], private sellers and landlords were not allowed to list their properties on the site.\n\nThe website charged property professionals and property related services companies for geo-targeted [[Web banner|banner ads]]. There were also premium services available to estate and letting agents (such as [[Search Engine Optimization]] consultancy, branded email alerts and increased traffic) and [[Google Ads]] were displayed in unsold advertising positions on the right hand side of search results.\n\n==Functionality==\n\nThe basic property search functionality is kept simple with just one text box on the homepage. Users can search for property by location (e.g. city, town, full postcode, partial postcode or, unusually for property portals, street name), places of interest (e.g. schools, stations, landmarks) or by key features (e.g. swimming pool, garden, double glazing, helipad).\n\nSearch results can then be refined further by changing the price parameters, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property type (e.g. detached, bungalow, flat), outside space, nearby stations and schools and property features (e.g. wooden floors, sea view). Registered users are able to search by additional parameters such as price change.\n\nAs an alternative to the regular \'list view\' of property results, users can also opt to see the search results plotted on [[Bing Maps]] (previously they used [[Google map]]) to allow users to look for property by location. (Some users are unimpressed with the lack of precision of the inferior Bing offering, which often manages to put the marker in a field, compared to the accuracy and ease of use of Googlemaps).  Users are able to drag and zoom the map, with relevant properties automatically placed in view. It is also possible for users to draw a catchment area directly onto the map of where they would like to search.\n\n==Data==\n\nGlobrix data was sometimes used by the national media to illustrate stories on house prices,<ref>House prices drop \xc2\xa3100,000 in two weeks in race to sell before Christmas - Daily Mail [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1089563/House-prices-drop-100-000-WEEKS-race-sell-Christmas.html]</ref> the economy, area trends, consumer confidence<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7737507.stm House sales rise as prices fall - BBC News]</ref> and the property market.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/3268208/Housing-market-stagnates-as-buyers-disappear.html Housing market stagnates as buyers disappear - Daily Telegraph]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n\nIn 2008, Globrix was awarded \'Best Property Portal UK\' which is awarded by one of the group\'s own newspapers, the [[The Daily Mail]].<ref>[http://www.residentialpropertyawards.net/index.php/International/Winners/Winners-of-2008.html Daily Mail Property Awards 2008]</ref> Globrix also won \'Estate Agency Service Firm of the Year\' at The Negotiator Awards.<ref>[http://negotiator-magazine.co.uk/events/awards/categories-and-finalists/agency-service-firm-of-the-year/ The Negotiator Awards 2008]</ref>\n\n==Founders==\n\nGlobrix was founded by Dan Lee and Ian Parry, both ex employees of UK-based search company [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] and the Norwegian search company [[Fast Search & Transfer|FAST]].\n\n==Merged with Zoopla==\n\nIn December 2012 Globrix merged with [[Zoopla]].<ref name="Estate Agent Today">{{cite web|title=Zoopla acquires Globrix as it steps up battle against Rightmove|url=http://www.estateagenttoday.co.uk/news_features/Zoopla-acquires-Globrix-as-it-steps-up-battle-against-Rightmove|work=Estate Agent Today|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.globrix.com/ Globrix homepage]\n* [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bc401968-824e-11dc-8a8f-0000779fd2ac.html News International invests in search engine] - Financial Times\n* [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/home-search-sites-have-a-new-kid-on-the-block-786342.html Home search sites have a new kid on the block] - The Independent\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Internet search engines]]\n[[Category:Online real estate companies]]'

S'\'\'\'Scientific data archiving\'\'\' is  the [[Computer_data_storage#Volatility|long-term storage]] of [[scientific data]] and methods. The various scientific journals have differing policies regarding how much of their data and methods scientists are required to store in a public archive, and what is actually archived varies widely between different disciplines. Similarly, the major grant-giving institutions have varying attitudes towards public archival of data. In general, the tradition of science has been for publications to contain sufficient information to allow fellow researchers to replicate and therefore test the research. In recent years this approach has become increasingly strained as   research in some areas depends on large datasets which cannot easily be replicated independently.\n\n[[Data archiving]] is more important in some fields than others.  In a few fields, all of the data necessary to replicate the work is already available in the journal article.  In drug development, a great deal of data is generated and must be archived so researchers can verify that the reports the drug companies publish accurately reflect the data.\n\nThe requirement of data archiving is a recent development in the [[history of science]].  It was made possible by advances in [[information technology]] allowing large amounts of data to be stored and accessed from central locations.  For example, the [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) adopted their first policy on data archiving in 1993, about three years after the beginning of the [[WWW]].<ref>\xe2\x80\x9dPolicy on Referencing Data in and Archiving Data for AGU Publications\xe2\x80\x9d [http://www.agu.org/pubs/authors/policies/data_policy.shtml]</ref> This policy mandates that datasets cited in AGU papers must be archived by a recognised data center; it permits the creation of "data papers"; and it establishes AGU\'s role in maintaining data archives. But it makes no requirements on paper authors to archive their data.\n\nPrior to organized data archiving, researchers wanting to evaluate or replicate a paper would have to request data and methods information from the author.  The science community expects authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share supplemental data]].  This process was recognized as wasteful of time and energy and obtained mixed results.  Information could become lost or corrupted over the years.  In some cases, authors simply refuse to provide the information.\n\nThe need for data archiving and due diligence is greatly increased when the research deals with health issues or public policy formation.<ref>"The Case for Due Diligence When Empirical Research is Used in Policy Formation" by Bruce McCullough and Ross McKitrick. [http://economics.ca/2006/papers/0685.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://gking.harvard.edu/replication.shtml "Data Sharing and Replication" a website by Gary King]</ref>\n\n==Selected policies by journals==\n\n===The American Naturalist===\n{{quote|[[The American Naturalist]]\'\' requires authors to deposit the data associated with accepted papers in a public archive. For gene sequence data and phylogenetic trees, deposition in [[GenBank]] or [[TreeBASE]], respectively, is required. There are many possible archives that may suit a particular data set, including the [[Dryad (repository)|Dryad]] repository for ecological and evolutionary biology data. All accession numbers for GenBank, TreeBASE, and Dryad must be included in accepted manuscripts before they go to Production. If the data is deposited somewhere else, please provide a link. If the data is culled from published literature, please deposit the collated data in Dryad for the convenience of your readers. Any impediments to data sharing should be brought to the attention of the editors at the time of submission so that appropriate arrangements can be worked out.|JSTOR<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/page/journal/amernatu/forAuthor.html#data Supporting Data and Material]</ref>}}\n\n===Journal of Heredity===\n{{quote|The primary data underlying the conclusions of an article are critical to the verifiability and transparency of the scientific enterprise, and should be preserved in usable form for decades in the future.

Accession numbers must be included in the final version of the manuscript. For other forms of data (e.g., microsatellite genotypes, linkage maps, images), the Journal endorses the principles of the Joint Data Archiving Policy (JDAP) in encouraging all authors to archive primary datasets in an appropriate public archive, such as Dryad, TreeBASE, or the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity.

S'\'\'\'{{Redirect|Reverse DNS}}\n\nIn [[computer networking]], \'\'\'reverse DNS lookup\'\'\' or \'\'\'reverse DNS resolution\'\'\' (rDNS) is the determination of a [[domain name]] that is associated with a given  [[IP address]] using the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) of the [[Internet]].\n\nComputer networks use the Domain Name System to determine the IP address associated with a domain name. This process is also known as \'\'forward\'\' DNS resolution.  \'\'Reverse\'\' DNS lookup is the inverse process, the resolution of an IP address to its designated domain name.\n\nThe reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in the \'\'Address and Routing Parameter Area\'\' (<tt>[[.arpa|arpa]]</tt>) [[top-level domain]] of the Internet. [[IPv4]] uses the <tt>in-addr.arpa</tt> domain and the <tt>ip6.arpa</tt> domain is delegated for [[IPv6]]. The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses the \'\'pointer\'\' DNS record type ([[List of DNS record types#Resource records|PTR record]]).\n\nInformational RFCs (RFC 1033, RFC 1912 Section 2.1) specify that \'\'"Every Internet-reachable host should have a name"\'\' and that such names match with a reverse pointer record, but it is not a requirement of standards governing operation of the DNS itself.\n\n==IPv4 reverse resolution==\nReverse DNS lookups for [[IPv4]] addresses use a \'\'reverse IN-ADDR entry\'\' in the special domain <tt>in-addr.arpa</tt>. In this domain, an IPv4 address is represented as a concatenated sequence of \'\'four decimal numbers\'\', separated by dots, to which is appended the second level domain suffix <tt>.in-addr.arpa</tt>. The four decimal numbers are obtained by splitting the 32-bit IPv4 address into four 8-bit portions and converting each 8-bit portion into a decimal number.  These decimal numbers are then concatenated in the order: least significant 8-bit portion first (leftmost), most significant 8-bit portion last (rightmost). It is important to note that \'\'this is the reverse order to the usual dotted-decimal convention for writing IPv4 addresses\'\' in textual form.\nFor example, an address (A) record for <tt>mail.example.com</tt> points to the IP address 192.0.2.5.\nIn pointer records of the reverse database, this IP address is stored as the domain name <tt>5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa</tt> pointing back to its designated host name <tt>mail.example.com</tt>. \nThis allows it to pass the [[Forward Confirmed reverse DNS]] process.\n\n===Classless reverse DNS method===\nHistorically, Internet registries and Internet service providers allocated IP addresses in blocks of 256 (for Class C) or larger octet-based blocks for classes B and A.  By definition, each block fell upon an octet boundary. The structure of the reverse DNS domain was based on this definition. However, with the introduction of [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]], IP addresses were allocated in much smaller blocks, and hence the original design of pointer records was impractical, since autonomy of administration of smaller blocks could not be granted. RFC 2317 devised a methodology to address this problem by using \'\'canonical name\'\' ([[CNAME]]) DNS records.\n\n==IPv6 reverse resolution==\nReverse DNS lookups for [[IPv6]] addresses use the special domain <code>ip6.arpa</code>. An IPv6 address appears as a name in this domain as a sequence of [[nibble]]s in reverse order, represented as hexadecimal digits as subdomains. For example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the IPv6 address <code>2001:db8::567:89ab</code> is <code>b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa</code>.\n\n==Multiple pointer records==\nWhile most rDNS entries only have one PTR record, DNS does not restrict the number. However, having multiple PTR records for the same IP address is generally not recommended, unless there is a specific need.  For example, if a web server supports many [[virtual host]]s, there may be one PTR record for each host and some versions of name server software will allocate this automatically.  Multiple PTR records can cause problems, however, including triggering bugs in programs that only expect single PTR records.<ref>[http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5790 glibc bug #5790]</ref> In the case of a large web server, having hundreds of PTR records can cause the DNS packets to be much larger than normal, which can cause responses to be truncated if they exceed the DNS 512 byte UDP message limit.\n\n==Records other than PTR records==\nRecord types other than PTR records may also appear in the reverse DNS tree. For example, encryption keys may be placed there for [[IPsec]] (RFC 4025), [[Secure Shell|SSH]] (RFC 4255) and [[Internet Key Exchange|IKE]] (RFC 4322).\n[[Zero-configuration networking#DNS-SD|DNS-Based Service Discovery]] (RFC 6763) uses specially-named records in the reverse DNS tree to provide hints to clients about subnet-specific service discovery domains.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = IETF | title = RFC\xe2\x80\xaf6763 | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763#section-11}}</ref>\nLess standardized usages include comments placed in [[TXT record]]s and [[LOC record]]s to identify the geophysical location of an IP address.\n\n==Uses==\nThe most common uses of the reverse DNS include:\n* The original use of the rDNS: network troubleshooting via tools such as [[traceroute]], [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]], and the "Received:" trace header field for [[SMTP]] e-mail, web sites tracking users (especially on [[Internet forum]]s), etc.\n* One [[anti-spam techniques (e-mail)#PTR.2Freverse DNS checks|e-mail anti-spam technique]]: checking the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dialup users, dynamically assigned addresses, or other inexpensive Internet services.  Owners of such IP addresses typically assign them generic rDNS names such as "1-2-3-4-dynamic-ip.example.com."  Some corporate anti-spam services take the view that the vast majority, but by no means all, of e-mail that originates from these computers is spam with spam filters refusing e-mail with such rDNS names.<ref>[http://www.spamhaus.org/faq/answers.lasso?section=ISP%20Spam%20Issues#131 spamhaus\'s FAQ]</ref><ref>[http://postmaster.aol.com/info/rdns.html reference page from AOL]</ref> However data has shown that just as much if not more spam has originated from unpatched machines within corporate networks that are more likely to use out of date browsers than cheaper services such as DSL networks not to mention the difficulty of blocking spam from major providers like Yahoo and Hotmail. A recent shift has shown that spamming has switched to mainly coming from hosting companies making using rDNS even less useful.<ref>http://www.mailchannels.com/blog/2013/03/worlds-largest-spam-sources-are-all-hosting-companies/</ref> All of this adds to the argument that the few services that choose to block email servers purely on the basis of rDNS are simply discriminating without merit and often miss out more pro-active and useful indiscriminate anti spam measures.<ref>http://ask.slashdot.org/story/11/10/13/1643202/ask-slashdot-is-reverse-dns-a-worthy-standard-for-fighting-spam</ref>\n* A [[forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] (FCrDNS) verification can create a form of authentication showing a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the server that has been given an IP address. While not very thorough, this validation is strong enough to often be used for [[whitelist]]ing purposes, mainly because [[Spam (electronic)|spammers]] and [[Phishing|phishers]] usually can\'t pass verification for it when they use [[zombie computer]]s to forge domains.\n* System logging or monitoring tools often receive entries with the relevant devices specified only by IP addresses. To provide more human-usable data, these programs often perform a reverse lookup before writing the log, thus writing a name rather than the IP address\n\n==See also==\n*[[Forward-confirmed reverse DNS]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Internet/Protocols/DNS/Web_Tools|Web-based DNS lookup tools}}\n* [http://dns.icann.org ICANN DNS Operations]\n* RFC 2317 documents a way to do rDNS delegation for [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|CIDR]] blocks\n* [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3596 RFC 3596 DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6]\n* RDNS policies: [http://postmaster.aol.com/Postmaster.Errors.php#whatisrdns AOL], [http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/fix-a-554-error/ Comcast], [http://www.craigslist.org/about/help/rdns_failure Craigslist], [https://www.misk.com/kb/reverse-dns Misk.com]\n\n[[Category:Searching]]\n[[Category:Domain name system]]\n\n[[nl:Domain Name System#Omgekeerde lookups]]\'\'\''

S'\'\'\'Discounted cumulative gain\'\'\' (\'\'\'DCG\'\'\') is a measure of ranking quality. In [[information retrieval]], it is often used to measure effectiveness of [[World Wide Web|web]] [[search engine]] [[algorithm]]s or related applications. Using a [[Relevance (information retrieval)|graded relevance]] scale of documents in a search engine result set, DCG measures the usefulness, or \'\'gain\'\', of a document based on its position in the result list. The gain is accumulated from the top of the result list to the bottom with the gain of each result discounted at lower ranks.<ref>Kalervo Jarvelin, Jaana Kekalainen: Cumulated gain-based evaluation of IR techniques. ACM Transactions on Information Systems 20(4), 422\xe2\x80\x93446 (2002)</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nTwo assumptions are made in using DCG and its related measures.\n\n# Highly relevant documents are more useful when appearing earlier in a search engine result list (have higher ranks)\n# Highly relevant documents are more useful than marginally relevant documents, which are in turn more useful than irrelevant documents.\n\nDCG originates from an earlier, more primitive, measure called Cumulative Gain.\n\n=== Cumulative Gain ===\n\nCumulative Gain (CG) is the predecessor of DCG and does not include the position of a result in the consideration of the usefulness of a result set. In this way, it is the sum of the graded relevance values of all results in a search result list. The CG at a particular rank position <math>p</math> is defined as:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{CG_{p}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} rel_{i} </math>\n\nWhere <math>rel_{i}</math> is the graded relevance of the result at position <math>i</math>.\n\nThe value computed with the CG function is unaffected by changes in the ordering of search results. That is, moving a highly relevant document <math>d_{i}</math> above a higher ranked, less relevant, document <math>d_{j}</math> does not change the computed value for CG. Based on the two assumptions made above about the usefulness of search results, DCG is used in place of CG for a more accurate measure.\n\n=== Discounted Cumulative Gain ===\n\nThe premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result. The discounted CG accumulated at a particular rank position <math>p</math> is defined as:<ref name="stanfordireval">{{cite web|title=Introduction to Information Retrieval - Evaluation|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276/handouts/EvaluationNew-handout-6-per.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=23 March 2014|date=21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{DCG_{p}} = rel_1 + \\sum_{i=2}^{p} \\frac{rel_{i}}{\\log_{2}(i)} </math>\n\nPreviously there has not been shown any theoretically sound justification for using a [[logarithm]]ic reduction factor<ref>{{cite book | title=Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice | author=B. Croft, D. Metzler, and T. Strohman |year=2009 | publisher=\'\'Addison Wesley"}}</ref> other than the fact that it produces a smooth reduction.\n\nAn alternative formulation of DCG<ref>Chris Burges, Tal Shaked, Erin Renshaw, Ari Lazier, Matt Deeds, Nicole Hamilton, and Greg Hullender. 2005. Learning to rank using gradient descent. In Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on Machine learning (ICML \'05). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 89-96. DOI=10.1145/1102351.1102363 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1102351.1102363</ref> places stronger emphasis on retrieving relevant documents:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{DCG_{p}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\frac{ 2^{rel_{i}} - 1 }{ \\log_{2}(i+1)} </math>\n\nThe latter formula is commonly used in industry including major web search companies<ref name="stanfordireval"/> and data science competition platform such as Kaggle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain|url=https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/NormalizedDiscountedCumulativeGain|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Croft, Metzler and Strohman (page 320, 2010), the authors mistakenly claim that these two formulations of DCG are the same when the relevance values of documents are [[binary function|binary]]; <math>rel_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}</math>.  To see that they are not the same, let there be one relevant document and that relevant document is at rank 2.  The first version of DCG equals 1 / log2(2) = 1.  The second version of DCG equals 1 / log2(2+1) = 0.631.  The way that the two formulations of DCG are the same for binary judgments is in the way gain in the numerator is calculated.  For both formulations of DCG, binary relevance produces gain at rank i of 0 or 1.  No matter the number of relevance grades, the two formulations differ in their discount of gain.\n\nNote that Croft et al. (2010) and Burges et al. (2005) present the second DCG with a log of base e, while both versions of DCG above use a log of base 2.  When computing NDCG with the second formulation of DCG, the base of the log does not matter, but the base of the log does affect the value of NDCG for the first formulation.  Clearly, the base of the log affects the value of DCG in both formulations.\n\nRecently, Wang et al.(2013)<ref>Yining Wang, Liwei Wang, Yuanzhi Li, Di He, Wei Chen, Tie-Yan Liu. 2013. A Theoretical Analysis of NDCG Ranking Measures. In Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2013).</ref> give theoretical guarantee for using the logarithmic reduction factor in NDCG. Specifically, the authors prove for every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost all datasets.\n\n=== Normalized DCG ===\n\nSearch result lists vary in length depending on the [[Web search query|query]]. Comparing a search engine\'s performance from one query to the next cannot be consistently achieved using DCG alone, so the cumulative gain at each position for a chosen value of <math>p</math> should be normalized across queries. This is done by sorting documents of a result list by relevance, producing the maximum possible DCG till position <math>p</math>, also called Ideal DCG (IDCG) till that position. For a query, the \'\'normalized discounted cumulative gain\'\', or nDCG, is computed as:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{nDCG_{p}} = \\frac{DCG_{p}}{IDCG_{p}} </math>\n\nThe nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a search engine\'s ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the <math>DCG_p</math> will be the same as the <math>IDCG_p</math> producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable.\n\nThe main difficulty encountered in using nDCG is the unavailability of an ideal ordering of results when only partial [[relevance feedback]] is available.\n\n== Example ==\n\nPresented with a list of documents in response to a search query, an experiment participant is asked to judge the relevance of each document to the query. Each document is to be judged on a scale of 0-3 with 0 meaning irrelevant, 3 meaning completely relevant, and 1 and 2 meaning "somewhere in between". For the documents ordered by the ranking algorithm as\n\n:<math> D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}, D_{4}, D_{5}, D_{6} </math>\n\nthe user provides the following relevance scores:\n\n:<math> 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2 </math>\n\nThat is: document 1 has a relevance of 3, document 2 has a relevance of 2, etc. The Cumulative Gain of this search result listing is:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{CG_{6}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} rel_{i} = 3 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 11</math>\n\nChanging the order of any two documents does not affect the CG measure. If <math>D_3</math> and <math>D_4</math> are switched, the CG remains the same, 11. DCG is used to emphasize highly relevant documents appearing early in the result list. Using the logarithmic scale for reduction, the DCG for each result in order is:\n\n{| class="wikitable" border="1"\n|-\n! <math>i</math>\n! <math>rel_{i}</math>\n! <math>\\log_{2}i</math>\n! <math> \\frac{rel_{i}}{\\log_{2}i} </math>\n|-\n| 1\n| 3\n| 0\n| N/A\n|-\n| 2\n| 2\n| 1\n| 2\n|-\n| 3\n| 3\n| 1.585\n| 1.892\n|-\n| 4\n| 0\n| 2.0\n| 0\n|-\n| 5\n| 1\n| 2.322\n| 0.431\n|-\n| 6\n| 2\n| 2.584\n| 0.774\n|}\n\nSo the <math>DCG_{6}</math> of this ranking is:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{DCG_{6}} = rel_{1} + \\sum_{i=2}^{6} \\frac{rel_{i}}{\\log_{2}i} = 3 + (2 + 1.892 + 0 + 0.431 + 0.774) = 8.10</math>\n\nNow a switch of <math>D_3</math> and <math>D_4</math> results in a reduced DCG because a less relevant document is placed higher in the ranking; that is, a more relevant document is discounted more by being placed in a lower rank.\n\nThe performance of this query to another is incomparable in this form since the other query may have more results, resulting in a larger overall DCG which may not necessarily be better. In order to compare, the DCG values must be normalized.\n\nTo normalize DCG values, an ideal ordering for the given query is needed. For this example, that ordering would be the [[Monotonic|monotonically decreasing]] sort of the relevance judgments provided by the experiment participant, which is:\n\n:<math> 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0 </math>\n\nThe DCG of this ideal ordering, or \'\'IDCG\'\', is then:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{IDCG_{6}} = 8.69 </math>\n\nAnd so the nDCG for this query is given as:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{nDCG_{6}} = \\frac{DCG_{6}}{IDCG_{6}} = \\frac{8.10}{8.69} = 0.932 </math>\n\n== Limitations ==\n# Normalized DCG metric does not penalize for bad documents in the result. For example, if a query returns two results with scores <math> 1,1,1 </math> and <math> 1,1,1,0 </math> respectively, both would be considered equally good even if later contains a bad result. One way to take into account this limitation is use <math>1 - 2^{rel_{i}}</math> in numerator for scores for which we want to penalize and <math>2^{rel_{i}} - 1</math> for all others. For example, for the ranking judgments <math>Excellent, Fair, Bad</math> one might use numerical scores <math>1,0,-1</math> instead of <math>2,1,0</math>.\n# Normalized DCG does not penalize for missing documents in the result. For example, if a query returns two results with scores <math> 1,1,1 </math> and <math> 1,1,1,1,1 </math> respectively, both would be considered equally good. One way to take into account this limitation is to enforce fixed set size for the result set and use minimum scores for the missing documents. In previous example, we would use the scores <math> 1,1,1,0,0 </math> and <math> 1,1,1,1,1 </math> and quote nDCG as nDCG@5.\n# Normalized DCG may not be suitable to measure performance of queries that may typically often have several equally good results. This is especially true when this metric is limited to only first few results as it is done in practice. For example, for queries such as "restaurants" nDCG@1 would account for only first result and hence if one result set contains only 1 restaurant from the nearby area while the other contains 5, both would end up having same score even though latter is more comprehensive.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval|*]]'

S"'''Multimedia search''' enables information [[Search engine technology|search]] using queries in multiple data types including text and other [[multimedia]] formats.\nMultimedia search can be implemented through [[multimodal search]] interfaces, i.e., interfaces that allow to submit [[search queries]] not only as textual requests, but also through other media.\nWe can distinguish two methodologies in multimedia search:\n*'''Metadata search''': the search is made on the layers of [[metadata]].\n* '''[[Query by example]]''': The interaction consists in submitting a piece of information (e.g., a video, an image, or a piece of audio) at the purpose of finding similar multimedia items.\n\n\n==Metadata search==\n\nSearch is made using the layers in metadata which contain information of the content of a multimedia file. Metadata search is easier, faster and effective because instead of working with complex material, such as an audio, a video or an image, it searches using text.\n\nThere are three processes which should be done in this method:\n*'''[[Multimedia Information Retrieval#Feature Extraction Methods|Summarization of media content]]''' ([[feature extraction]]). The result of feature extraction is a description.\n*'''[[ Multimedia Information Retrieval#Feature Extraction Methods |Filtering of media descriptions]]''' (for example, elimination of [[Redundancy (linguistics)|Redundancy]])\n*'''[[ Multimedia Information Retrieval#Categorization Methods | Categorization of media descriptions ]]''' into classes.\n\n==[[Query by Example]]==\n\nIn [[query by example]] the element used to search is a [[multimedia]] content (image, audio, video). In other words, the query is a media. Often it\xe2\x80\x99s used [[Search engine indexing |audiovisual indexing]]. It will be necessary to choose the criteria we are going to use for creating metadata. The process of search can be divided in three parts:\n*Generate descriptors for the media which we are going to use as query and the descriptors for the media in our [[database]].\n*Compare descriptors of the query and our database\xe2\x80\x99s media.\n*List the media sorted by maximum coincidence.\n\n==Multimedia search engine==\nThere are two big search families, in function of the content:\n* [[Visual search engine]]\n*[[Audio search engine]]\n\n===[[Visual search engine]]===\nInside this family we can distinguish two topics: [[image search]] and [[video search]]\n\n*'''[[Image search]]''': Although usually it\xe2\x80\x99s used simple metadata search, increasingly is being used indexing methods for making the results of users queries more accurate using [[query by example]]. For example [[QR codes]].\n*'''[[Video search]]''': Videos can be searched for simple metadata or by complex metadata generated by indexing. The audio contained in the videos is usually scanned by audio search engines.\n\n===[[Audio search engine]]===\nThere are different methods of audio searching:\n*Voice search engine: Allows the user to search using speech instead of text. It uses algorithms of [[speech recognition]]. An example of this technology is [[Google Voice Search]].\n*Music search engine: Although most of applications which searches music works on simple metadata (artist, name of track, album\xe2\x80\xa6) .

Based on the [[semantics]] of [[Z39.50]], its design objective is that queries be human readable and writable, and that the language be intuitive while maintaining the expressiveness of more complex [[query language]]s.

S'\'\'\'Relevance [[feedback]]\'\'\' is a feature of some [[information retrieval]] systems.  The idea behind relevance feedback is to take the results that are initially returned from a given query and to use information about whether or not those results are relevant to perform a new query.  We can usefully distinguish between three types of feedback: explicit feedback, implicit feedback, and blind or "pseudo" feedback.\n\n== Explicit feedback ==\n\nExplicit feedback is obtained from assessors of relevance indicating the relevance of a document retrieved for a query. This type of feedback is defined as explicit only when the assessors (or other users of a system) know that the feedback provided is interpreted as [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] judgments.\n\nUsers may indicate relevance explicitly using a \'\'binary\'\' or \'\'graded\'\' relevance system. Binary relevance feedback indicates that a document is either relevant or irrelevant for a given query. Graded relevance feedback indicates the relevance of a document to a query on a scale using numbers, letters, or descriptions (such as "not relevant", "somewhat relevant", "relevant", or "very relevant"). Graded relevance may also take the form of a cardinal ordering of documents created by an assessor; that is, the assessor places documents of a result set in order of (usually descending) relevance.  An example of this would be the [[SearchWiki]] feature implemented by [[Google]] on their search website.\n\nThe relevance feedback information needs to be interpolated with the original query to improve retrieval performance, such as the well-known [[Rocchio Classification#Algorithm|Rocchio Algorithm]].\n\nA performance [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] which became popular around 2005 to measure the usefulness of a ranking [[algorithm]] based on the explicit relevance feedback is [[NDCG]]. Other measures include [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] at \'\'k\'\' and [[Mean average precision#Mean average precision|mean average precision]].\n\n== Implicit feedback ==\n\nImplicit feedback is inferred from user behavior, such as noting which documents they do and do not select for viewing, the duration of time spent viewing a document, or page browsing or scrolling actions [http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/etc/mongrel/kelly-belkin-SIGIR2001.pdf].\n\nThe key differences of implicit relevance feedback from that of explicit include [http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/papers/kelly.sigirforum03.pdf]:\n\n# the user is not assessing relevance for the benefit of the IR system, but only satisfying their own needs and\n# the user is not necessarily informed that their behavior (selected documents) will be used as relevance feedback\n\nAn example of this is the [[Surf Canyon]] [[browser extension]], which advances search results from later pages of the result set based on both user interaction (clicking an icon) and time spent viewing the page linked to in a search result.\n\n== Blind feedback ==\n\nPseudo relevance feedback, also known as  blind relevance feedback, provides a method for automatic local analysis. It automates the manual part of relevance feedback, so that the user gets improved retrieval performance without an extended interaction. The method is to do normal retrieval to find an initial set of most relevant documents, to then assume that the top "k" ranked documents are relevant, and finally to do relevance feedback as before under this assumption. The procedure is:\n\n# Take the results returned by initial query as relevant results (only top k with k being between 10 to 50 in most experiments).\n# Select top 20-30 (indicative number) terms from these documents using for instance [[tf-idf]] weights.\n# Do Query Expansion, add these terms to query, and then match the returned documents for this query and finally return the most relevant documents.\n\nSome experiments such as results from the Cornell SMART system published in (Buckley et al.1995), show improvement of retrieval systems performances using pseudo-relevance feedback in the context of TREC 4 experiments.\n\nThis automatic technique mostly works. Evidence suggests that it tends to work better than global analysis.<ref>Jinxi Xu and W. Bruce Croft, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=243202\'\'Query expansion using local and global document analysis\'\'], in Proceedings of the 19th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR), 1996.</ref> Through a query expansion, some relevant documents missed in the initial round can then be retrieved to improve the overall performance. Clearly, the effect of this method strongly relies on the quality of selected expansion terms. It has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. But it is not without the dangers of an automatic process. For example, if the query is about copper mines and the top several documents are all about mines in Chile, then there may be query drift in the direction of documents on Chile. In addition, if the words added to the original query are unrelated to the query topic, the quality of the retrieval is likely to be degraded, especially in Web search, where web documents often cover multiple different topics. To improve the quality of expansion words in pseudo-relevance feedback, a positional relevance feedback for pseudo-relevance feedback has been proposed to select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of words in feedback documents.<ref>Yuanhua Lv and ChengXiang Zhai, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1835546\'\'Positional relevance model for pseudo-relevance feedback\'\'], in Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR), 2010.</ref> \nSpecifically, the positional relevance model assigns more weights to words occurring closer to query words based on the intuition that words closer to query words are more likely to be related to the query topic.\n\nBlind feedback automates the manual part of relevance feedback and has the advantage that assessors are not required.\n\n== Using relevance information ==\n\nRelevance information is utilized by using the contents of the relevant documents to either adjust the weights of terms in the original query, or by using those contents to add words to the query.  Relevance feedback is often implemented using the [[Rocchio Classification#Algorithm|Rocchio Algorithm]].\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/LBSC796-INFM718R-2006-Spring/lecture7.ppt Relevance feedback lecture notes] - Jimmy Lin\'s lecture notes, adapted from Doug Oard\'s\n*[http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/chapters/chap10.html] - chapter from \'\'Modern Information Retrieval\'\'\n*Stefan B\xc3\xbcttcher, Charles L.

S'{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2009}}\n{{orphan|date=February 2009}}\n{{confusing|date=March 2009}}\n}}\n\n\'\'\'Negative Search\'\'\' is the elimination of information which is not relevant from a mass of content in order to present to a user a range of relevant content.\n\nNegative Search is different from both Positive Search and Discovery Search. Positive Search uses the selection of relevant content as its primary mechanism. Discovery calculates relatedness (between user intent and content) to present users with relevant alternatives of which they may not have been aware.\n\nNegative Search applies to those forms of searches where the user has the intention of finding a specific, actionable piece information but lacks the knowledge of what that specific information is or might be.\n\nNegative Search can also apply to searches where the user has a clear understanding of \'\'\'Negative Intent\'\'\' (what they don\'t want) rather than what they do.\n\nExamples of Negative Intent are:\n\n- Job searching: someone knows they want a new job but they have no idea what it might be. They just know what they don\'t want.\n\n- Online dating: someone is looking for a dating partner, but cannot identify what criteria they are looking for. They just know what they don\'t want.\n\n- An investigator is looking for a car but has no other information on that car on which to base a search.\n\n==Negative Search Classifiers==\n\nIf there are two forms of search (positive and negative) it follows that there are two forms of classifier models: \'\'\'Inclusive Classifiers\'\'\' and \'\'\'Exclusive Classifiers\'\'\'.\n\n[[List of countries|Countries of the World]] are a good example of a MECE list. A positive search for the country Kenya would identify content referencing Kenya and present it. A Negative Search for the country Kenya would exclude all content relating to other countries in the world leaving the user with content of some relevance to Kenya.\n\n==Irrelevancy as a Desirable Construct==\n\nPositive Search tends to view Irrelevancy as undesirable. Having a system actively identify and pursue irrelevant content for the purpose of elimination from a [[user experience]] may prove a highly powerful mechanism.\n\nIt follows that Positive and Negative Search are not mutually exclusive and that a more powerful search may result from the combination of selection and elimination as tools to empower user experience in Negative Searches.\n\n==Degrees of Passivity==\n\nPositive Search involves an active search by a user with no degree of passivity (or openness). For example: "I am only interested in the Hilton Hotel in Vientiane on [[New Year\\\'s Eve|New Years Eve]]."\n\nDiscovery involves a simultaneous secondary more Passive search by the user while they are involved in a Positive search. For example: "I am interested in the Hilton Hotel in Vientiane on New Years Eve but if there\'s a better hotel, let me know"\n\nNegative Search also involves an Active search but with a much higher degree of Passivity (or openness to discovery). For example: "I need a holiday and really don\'t care where as long as its good."\n\nSearchers can be active in one dimension (Positive Search) while simultaneously being passive to alternatives or what they don\'t know they\'re looking for in many dimensions. In Discovery they are Passive in a small number of dimensions but in Negative Search they are Passive in many or all dimensions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

These tools are designed to find information on the user\'s PC, including web browser history, e-mail archives, text documents, sound files, images, and video.\n\nOne of the main advantages of desktop search programs is that search results are displayed quickly due to the use of proper indexes.\n\nA variety of desktop search programs are now available; see [[List of search engines#Desktop search engines|this list]] for examples.\n\nDesktop search emerged as a concern for large firms for two main reasons: untapped productivity and security. On the one hand, users needs to be able to quickly find relevant files, but on the other hand, they shouldn\'t have access to restricted files. According to analyst firm Gartner, up to 80% of some companies\' data is locked up inside [[unstructured data]] \xe2\x80\x94 the information stored on an end user\'s PC, the directories (folders) and files they\'ve created on a [[Computer network|network]], documents stored in repositories such as corporate [[intranet]]s and a multitude of other locations.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2006/04/25/215622/security-special-report-who-sees-your-data.htm | title = Security special report: Who sees your data? | newspaper = Computer Weekly | date = 2006-04-25}}.</ref>  Moreover, many companies have structured or unstructured information stored in older [[file formats]] to which they don\'t have ready access.\n\nCompanies doing business in the [[United States]] are frequently required under regulatory mandates like [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[FERPA]] to make sure that access to sensitive information is 100% controlled. This creates a challenge for IT organizations, which may not have a desktop search standard, or lack strict central control over end users [[downloading]] tools from the [[Internet]]. Some consumer-oriented desktop search tools make it possible to generate indexes outside the corporate [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and share those indexes with unauthorized users. In some cases, end users are able to index \xe2\x80\x94 but not preview \xe2\x80\x94 items they should not even know exist.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}}\n\nHistorically, full desktop search comes from the work of [[Apple inc.|Apple Computer\'s]] [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]], resulting in the underlying [[AppleSearch]] technology in the early 1990s. It was used to build the [[Sherlock (software)|Sherlock]] search engine and then developed into [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]], which brought automated, non-timer-based full indexing into the operating system.\n\n== Technologies ==\nMost desktop search engines build and maintain an [[Index (search engine)|index database]] to achieve reasonable performance when searching several [[gigabyte]]s of [[data]]. Indexing usually takes place when the computer is idle and most search applications can be set to suspend indexing if a portable computer is running on batteries, in order to save power. There are notable exceptions, however: Voidtools\' Everything Search Engine,<ref>{{cite web|title=Everything Search Engine|url=http://www.voidtools.com/|publisher=voidtools|accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> which performs searches over only filenames &mdash; not the files\' contents &mdash; for NTFS volumes only, is able to build its index from scratch in just a few seconds. Another exception is Vegnos Desktop Search Engine,<ref>{{cite web|title=Vegnos|url=http://www.vegnos.com|publisher=Vegnos|accessdate=27 December 2013}}</ref> which performs searches over filenames and files\' contents without building any indices. The benefits to not having indices is that, in addition to not requiring persistent storage, more powerful queries (e.g., [[regular expressions]]) can be issued, whereas indexed search engines are limited to keyword-based queries. An index may also not be up-to-date, when a query is performed. In this case, results returned will not be accurate (that is, a hit may be shown when it is no longer there, and a file may not be shown, when in fact it is a hit). Some products, such as Lookeen,<ref>{{cite web|title=Real-Time Indexing and Lookeen 8|url=http://www.lookeen.net/2884/News/real-time-ndexing-and-lookeen-8/|publisher=Lookeen|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> have sought to remedy this disadvantage by building a real-time indexing function into the software. There are disadvantages to not indexing. Namely, the time to complete a query can be significant, and the issued query can also be resource-intensive.\n\nDesktop search tools typically collect three types of information about files:\n* file and folder names\n* [[metadata]], such as titles, authors, comments in file types such as [[MP3]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[JPEG]]\n* file content (for supported types of documents only)\n\nTo search effectively within documents, the tools need to be able to parse many different types of documents. This is achieved by using filters that interpret selected file formats. For example, a \'\'Microsoft Office Filter\'\' might be used to search inside [[Microsoft Office]] documents.\n\nLong-term goals for desktop search include the ability to search the contents of image files, sound files and video by context.<ref>[http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/10/video-search.html "The current state of video search", by Niall Kennedy]</ref><ref>[http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/10/audio-search.html "The current state of audio search", by Niall Kennedy]</ref>\n\nThe sector attracted considerable attention from the struggle between Microsoft and Google.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3952285.stm "Search wars hit desktop computers". (Oct 2004) BBC News]</ref> According to market analysts, both companies were attempting to leverage their monopolies (of [[web browser]]s and [[search engine]]s, respectively) to strengthen their dominance. Due to [[Google]]\'s complaint that users of Windows Vista cannot choose any competitor\'s desktop search program over the built-in one, an agreement was reached between [[US Justice Department]] and [[Microsoft]] that [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1]] would enable users to choose between the built-in and other desktop search programs, and select which one is to be the default.<ref>[http://goebelgroup.com/searchtoolblog/2007/06/20/microsoft-agrees-to-change-vista-desktop-search-tool/ "Microsoft agrees to change Vista Desktop Search Tool" (Jun 2007)]</ref>\n\nAs of September, 2011, Google ended life for Google Desktop, a program designed to make it easy for users to search their own PCs for emails, files, music, photos, Web pages and more. <ref>[http://googledesktop.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-desktop-update.html/ "Google Desktop Update" (Sept 2011)]</ref>  \n\nX1 makes one of the leading desktop search products on the market. X1 Search 8 is a software alternative to Windows Desktop and Outlook Search, helping business professional sift through desktop files, emails, attachments, SharePoint data, and more. <ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/article/2475293/desktop-apps/x1-rises-again-with-desktop-search-8--virtual-edition.html/ "X1 rises again with Desktop Search 8, Virtual Edition" (May 2013)]</ref>   \n\n==Platforms & their histories==\nThere are three main platforms that desktop search falls into. [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS|Mac]] OS & [[Linux]]. This article will focus on the history of these search platforms, the features they had, and how those features evolved.\n\n\'\'\'Windows\'\'\'\n\nToday\'s Windows Search replaced WDS (Windows Desktop Search). WDS, in turn, replaced Indexing Service. A "a base service that extracts content from files and constructs an indexed catalog to facilitate efficient and rapid searching"<ref>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee805985%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</ref> Indexing service was originally released in August 1996, it was built in order to speed up manually searching for files on Personal Desktops and Corporate Computer Network. Indexing service helped by using Microsoft web servers to index files on the desired hard drives. Indexing was done by file format. By using terms that users provided, a search was conducted that matched terms to the data within the file formats. The largest issue that Indexing service faced was the fact that every time a file was added, it had to be indexed. This coupled with the fact that the indexing cached the entire index in RAM, made the hardware a huge limitation.<ref>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd582937%28v=office.11%29.aspx</ref> This made indexing large amounts of files require extremely powerful hardware and very long wait times.\n\nIn 2003, Windows Desktop Search (WDS) replaced Microsoft Indexing Service. Instead of only matching terms to the details of the file format and file names, WDS brings in content indexing to all Microsoft files and text-based formats such as e-mail and text files. This means, that WDS looked into the files and indexed the content. Thus, when a user searched a term, WDS no longer matched just information such as file format types and file names, but terms, and values stored within those files. WDS also brought "Instant searching" meaning the user could type a character and the query would instantly start searching and updating the query as the user typed in more characters.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20110924212903/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/techfaq.mspx</ref> Windows Search apparently used up a lot of processing power, as Windows Desktop Search would only run if it was directly queried or while the PC was idle. Even only running while directly queried or while the computer was idled, indexing the entire hard drive still took hours. The index would be around 10% of the size of all the files that it indexed. For example, if the indexed files amounted to around 100GB of space, the index would, itself, be 10GB large.\n\nWith the release of Windows Vista came Windows Search 3.1. Unlike it\'s predecessors WDS and Windows Search 3.0, 3.1 could search through both indexed and non indexed locations seamlessly. Also, the RAM and CPU requirements were greatly reduced. Cutting back indexing times immensely. This brings us to the Windows Search 4.0 which is currently running on all PCs with Windows 7 and up.\n\n\'\'\'Mac OS\'\'\'\n\nMac OS was the first to fully implement Desktop Search, it allowed users to fully search all documents with in their Macintosh computer. This means file format types, meta-data on those file formats and the content within the files. Released in 1994 two years before Windows Search was released, AppleSearch already had content searching. The biggest issue that AppleSearch had large resource requirements "AppleSearch requires at least a 68040 processor and 5MB of RAM."<ref>http://infomotions.com/musings/tricks/manuscript/1600-0001.html</ref> A Macintosh computer that had these specs cost around $1400 in today\'s dollars that\'s around $2050.<ref>http://stats.areppim.com/calc/calc_usdlrxdeflator.php</ref> On top of that, the software it self cost around $1400 for a single licenses.\n\nIn 1997, Sherlock was released alongside Mac OS 8.5. Sherlock, named after the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, was integrated into Mac OS\'s file browser: Finder. Sherlock extended the desktop search to the world wide web. Allowing users to now search locally and externally. Adding the web to Sherlock was relatively easy as the plugins only needed to be written in a plain text file. Sherlock was included in every single Mac OS 8, 9 and 10 until 10.5.\n\nSpotlight was released in 2005, on Mac OSX 10.4, is a Selection-based search which means the user invokes a query using only the mouse. It allows the user to search the Internet for more information about any keyword or phrase contained within a document or webpage. Spotlight also uses a built-in Oxford American Dictionary and calculator to offer quick access to definitions and small calculations.<ref>http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/04/12Apple-to-Ship-Mac-OS-X-Tiger-on-April-29.html</ref> While Spotlight had a initially long start-up time (for first time set up). The entire hard disk was indexed, and as files are added to the hard disk, the index is constantly being updated in the background. This is done using minimal CPU & RAM resources, making searching relatively easy and quick.\n\n\'\'\'Linux\'\'\'\n\nFor Linux, we will primarily cover the Ubuntu distribution as it was and currently is still the most popular version of Linux. Strangely enough, Ubuntu didn\'t have desktop search until Feisty Fawn 7.04. Using Tracker<ref>http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/07/afirst-look-at-tracker-0-6-0/</ref> desktop search, the desktop search feature was very similar to Mac OS\'s AppleSearch and Sherlock. Considering the fact that both are UNIX based systems. Tracker, was released in late 2007 was built to have a relatively low impact on system resources. But unfortunately occasionally had sporadic control over what resources it was using. It not only featured the basic features of file format sorting, and meta-data matching, but support for searching through emails and messages (instant messages) was added. Years later, in 2014 Recoll<ref>http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/index.html#RCL.INDEXING</ref> was added to Linux distributions, it works with other search programs such as Tracker and Beagle to provide efficient full text search. This greatly increased the types of queries that Linux desktop searches could handle as well as file types. The wonderful thing about Recoll is that it allows for greater customization of what is indexed. For example, Recoll will index the entire hard disk by default, but will and can index just a few select directories instead of wasting time indexing directories you know you will never need to look at. It also allows for more search options, you may actually narrow down what kind of query you want to ask. For example you could search for just file types or by content.<ref>http://archive09.linux.com/feature/114283</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of search engines#Desktop search engines|List of desktop search engines]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--* [http://ims.dei.unipd.it/members/agosti/teaching/2006-07/ir/ Maristella Agosti\'s website]-->\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* \'\'[http://www.slate.com/id/2111643/ Keeper Finders]\'\', by Paul Boutin, \'\'[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]\'\', December 31, 2004 &mdash; A comparison of Google, Ask Jeeves, HotBot, MSN and Copernic desktop search tools.\n* [http://www.goebelgroup.com/desktopmatrix.htm GoebelGroup.com\'s desktop search tools comparison chart] - Date of last update: 15 January 2007.\n* [http://labnol.blogspot.com/2004/10/detailed-comparison-of-desktop-search.html A detailed comparison of desktop search tools] - dated 2004.\n* [http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Comparison_of_desktop_search_software Comparison of desktop search software] - Date of last update: March 2008\n* [http://tbox.codeplex.com/ TBox] - DevTool, with ability to do fast search by text files\n\n{{Navigationbox Desktopsearch}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Desktop Search}}\n[[Category:Desktop search engines| ]]\n[[Category:Searching]]'

S'\'\'\'Definition:\'\'\' \'\'\'Enterprise search\'\'\' is the organized retrieval of \'\'\'structured\'\'\' and \'\'\'unstructured\'\'\' data within an organization. \n\n\n\'\'\'Enterprise search\'\'\' is the practice of making content from multiple enterprise-type sources, such as [[database]]s and [[intranet]]s, searchable to a defined audience.\n\n==Enterprise search summary==\n"Enterprise Search" is used to describe the software of search information within an enterprise (though the search function and its results may still be public).<ref>[http://www.aiim.org/What-is-Enterprise-Search What is Enterprise Search?]</ref> Enterprise search can be contrasted with [[web search]], which applies search technology to documents on the open web, and [[desktop search]], which applies search technology to the content on a single computer.\n\nEnterprise search systems index data and documents from a variety of sources such as: [[file systems]], [[intranets]], [[document management system]]s, [[e-mail]], and [[databases]]. Many enterprise search systems integrate structured and unstructured data in their collections.<ref>[http://www.arma.org/bookstore/files/Delgado.pdf The New Face of Enterprise Search: Bridging Structured and Unstructured Information]</ref> Enterprise search systems also use access controls to enforce a security policy on their users.<ref>[http://www.ideaeng.com/tabId/98/itemId/118/Mapping-Security-Requirements-to-Enterprise-Search.aspx Mapping Security Requirements to Enterprise Search - Part 1: Defining Specific Security Requirements]</ref>\n\nEnterprise search can be seen as a type of [[vertical search]] of an enterprise.\n\n==Components of an enterprise search system==\nIn an enterprise search system, content goes through various phases from source repository to search results:\n\n=== Content awareness ===\nContent awareness (or "content collection") is usually either a push or pull model. In the push model, a source system is integrated with the search engine in such a way that it connects to it and pushes new content directly to its [[API]]s. This model is used when realtime indexing is important. In the pull model, the software gathers content from sources using a connector such as a [[web crawler]] or a [[database]] connector. The connector typically polls the source with certain intervals to look for new, updated or deleted content.<ref>[http://www.information-management.com/issues/20_7/content_management_data_integration_indexing_metadata-10019105-1.html Understanding Content Collection and Indexing]</ref>\n\n=== Content processing and analysis ===\nContent from different sources may have many different formats or document types, such as XML, HTML, Office document formats or plain text. The content processing phase processes the incoming documents to plain text using document filters. It is also often necessary to normalize content in various ways to improve [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]] or [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]]. These may include [[stemming]], [[lemmatization]], [[synonym]] expansion, [[entity extraction]], [[part of speech]] tagging.\n\nAs part of processing and analysis, [[tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]] is applied to split the content into [[Lexical analysis#Token|tokens]] which is the basic matching unit. It is also common to normalize tokens to lower case to provide case-insensitive search, as well as to normalize accents to provide better recall.<ref>[http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/stemming.html Stemming, Variations, and Accent Folding]</ref>\n\n=== Indexing ===\nThe resulting text is stored in an [[Index (search engine)|index]], which is optimized for quick lookups without storing the full text of the document. The index may contain the dictionary of all unique words in the corpus as well as information about ranking and [[term frequency]].\n\n=== Query Processing ===\nUsing a web page, the user issues a [[Web search query|query]] to the system. The query consists of any terms the user enters as well as navigational actions such as [[faceted search|faceting]] and paging information.\n\n=== Matching ===\nThe processed query is then compared to the stored index, and the search system returns results (or "hits") referencing source documents that match. Some systems are able to present the document as it was indexed.\n\n==Differences from web search==\nBeyond the difference in the kinds of materials being indexed, enterprise search systems also typically include functionality that is not associated with the mainstream [[web search engine]]s. These include:\n*Adapters to index content from a variety of repositories, such as [[databases]] and [[content management systems]].\n*[[Federated search]], which consists of\n# transforming a query and broadcasting it to a group of disparate databases or external content sources with the appropriate syntax,\n# merging the results collected from the databases,\n# presenting them in a succinct and unified format with minimal duplication, and\n# providing a means, performed either automatically or by the portal user, to sort the merged result set.\n*[[Enterprise bookmarking]], collaborative [[tag (metadata)|tagging]] systems for capturing knowledge about structured and semi-structured enterprise data.\n*[[Entity extraction]] that seeks to locate and classify elements in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\n*[[Faceted search]], a technique for accessing a collection of information represented using a [[faceted classification]], allowing users to explore by filtering available information.\n*Access control, usually in the form of an [[Access control list]] (ACL), is often required to restrict access to documents based on individual user identities. There are many types of access control mechanisms for different content sources making this a complex task to address comprehensively in an enterprise search environment (see below).\n*[[Text clustering]], which groups the top several hundred search results into topics that are computed on the fly from the search-results descriptions, typically titles, excerpts (snippets), and meta-data.  This technique lets users navigate the content by topic rather than by the meta-data that is used in faceting. Clustering compensates for the problem of incompatible meta-data across multiple enterprise repositories, which hinders the usefulness of faceting.\n*[[User interfaces]], which in web search are deliberately kept simple in order not to distract the user from clicking on ads, which generates the revenue.  Although the business model for enterprise search could include showing ads, in practice this is not done.  To enhance end user productivity, enterprise vendors continually experiment with rich UI functionality which occupies significant screen space, which would be problematic for web search.\n\n==Relevance factors for enterprise search==\nThe factors that determine the relevance of search results within the context of an enterprise overlap with but are different from those that apply to web search. In general, enterprise search engines cannot take advantage of the rich [[hyperlink|link structure]] as is found on the web\'s [[hypertext]] content, however, a new breed of Enterprise search engines based on a bottom-up [[Web 2.0]] technology are providing both a contributory approach and [[hyperlink]]ing within the enterprise. Algorithms like [[PageRank]] exploit hyperlink structure to assign authority to documents, and then use that authority as a query-independent relevance factor. In contrast, enterprises typically have to use other query-independent factors, such as a document\'s recency or popularity, along with query-dependent factors traditionally associated with [[information retrieval]] algorithms.  Also, the rich functionality of enterprise search UIs, such as clustering and faceting, diminish reliance on ranking as the means to direct the user\'s attention.\n\n==Access Control - early binding vs late binding==\nSecurity and restricted access to documents is an important matter in Enteprise Search. There are two main approaches to apply restricted access: early binding vs late binding.<ref>[http://enterprisesearch.co/enterprise-search-document-access-control/ Enterprise Search: document access control]</ref>\n\n===Late binding===\nPermissions are analyzed and assigned to documents at query stage. Query engine generates a document set and before returning it to a user this set is filtered based on user access rights. It is costly process but accurate (based on user permissions at the moment of query).\n\n===Early binding===\nPermissions are analyzed and assigned to documents at indexing stage. It is much more effective than late binding, but could be inaccurate (user might be granted or revoked permissions between in the period between indexing and querying).\n\n==Search Relevance Testing options==\nSearch application relevance can be determined by following relevance testing options like<ref>[http://searchhub.org/2009/09/02/debugging-search-application-relevance-issues/  Debugging Search Application Relevance Issues]</ref>\n*Focus groups\n*Reference evaluation protocol (based on relevance judgements of results from agreed-upon queries performed against common document corpuses)\n*Empirical testing\n*[[A/B testing]]\n*Log analysis on a Beta production site\n*Online ratings\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comparison of enterprise search software]]\n*[[List of enterprise search vendors]]\n*[[List of Search Engines]]\n*[[Collaborative search engine]]\n*[[Data Defined Storage]] \n*[[Enterprise bookmarking]]\n*[[Enterprise information access]]\n*[[Knowledge management]]\n*[[Text mining]]\n*[[Faceted search]]\n*[[Information Extraction]]\n*[[Vertical search|Vertical Search]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Enterprise Search}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Searching]]'

Because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-[[computer]] era, only works of special importance, such as the [[Vedas]],<ref>{{cite book|first = Maurice | last = Bloomfield| authorlink = Maurice Bloomfield | title = A Vedic Concordance| year  = 1990| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 81-208-0654-9}}</ref> [[Bible]], [[Qur\'an]] or the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] or classical Latin and Greek authors,<ref>{{cite journal | first = Roy | last = Wisby | authorlink = Roy Wisby | title = Concordance Making by Electronic Computer: Some Experiences with the Wiener Genesis| journal = The Modern Language Review | publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 161\xe2\x80\x93172 | date = April 1962 | doi=10.2307/3720960}}</ref> had concordances prepared for them. \n[[File:Mordechai nathan hebrew latin concordance.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Mordecai Nathan\'s Hebrew-Latin Concordance of the Bible]]\nA concordance is more than an index; additional material, such as commentary, definitions, and topical cross-indexing make producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers.\n\nAlthough an automatically generated [[subject indexing|index]] lacks the richness of a published concordance, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing.  In addition, mathematical techniques such as [[Latent Semantic Indexing]] have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.\n\nA \'\'\'bilingual concordance\'\'\' is a concordance based on [[aligned parallel text]].\n\nA \'\'\'topical concordance\'\'\' is a list of subjects that a book (usually The Bible) covers, with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The most well known topical concordance is [[Nave\'s Topical Bible]].\n\nThe first concordance, to the [[Vulgate]] Bible, was compiled by [[Hugh of St Cher]] (d.1262), who employed 500 monks to assist him. In 1448 Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. 1599 saw a concordance to the Greek New Testament published by Henry Stephens and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden it did not employ the verse numbers devised by Robert Stephens in 1545 but "the pretty large concordance" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed [[Cruden\'s Concordance]] and [[Strong\'s Concordance]].\n\n==Use in linguistics==\nConcordances are frequently used in [[linguistics]], when studying a text. For example:    \n* comparing different usages of the same word\n* analysing keywords\n* analysing [[word frequencies]]\n* finding and analysing phrases and [[idioms]]\n* finding [[translation]]s of subsentential elements, e.g. [[terminology]], in [[Bitext#Bitexts and translation memories|bitexts and translation memories]]\n* creating indexes and word lists (also useful for publishing)\n\nConcordancing techniques are widely used in national corpora such as [[American National Corpus]], [[British National Corpus]], and [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] available on-line.  Stand-alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as concordancers.<ref>[http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith/introduction.htm?gclid=COjFnvGKhakCFVJX4Qod-RqjjQ Introduction to WordSmith]</ref> Some of them have integrated part-of-speech taggers and enable the user to create his/her own pos-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics.<ref>[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/linguistic-toobox-a-concordancer.html Linguistic Toolbox]</ref>\n\n==Inversion==\n\nThe reconstruction of the text of some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] involved a concordance.\n\nAccess to some of the scrolls was governed by a "secrecy rule" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of [[Roland de Vaux]] in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by [[Martin Abegg]] in 1991, who used a computer to "invert" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents.<ref>{{cite web |last= Hawrysch |first= George |title= Dr. George Hawrysch\'s speech on concordance book launch |work= The Ukrainian Weekly, No. 31, Vol. LXX |publisher= Ukrainian National Association |date= 2002-08-04 |url= http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2002/310217.shtml |accessdate= 2008-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Jillette |first= Penn |title= You May Already be a "Computer Expert" |url= http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc/deadsea.html |accessdate= 2008-06-14}}</ref> This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Back-of-the-book index]]\n* [[A Vedic Word Concordance]]\n* [[Bible concordance]]\n* [[Bitext]]\n* [[Concordancer]]\n* [[Cross-reference]]\n* [[Index (publishing)|Index]]\n* [[Key Word in Context|KWIC]]\n* [[Text mining]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/concordance/ Shakespeare concordance] - A concordance of Shakespeare\'s complete works (from Open Source Shakespeare)\n* [http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~ukr/skovoroda/NEW/ Online Concordance to the Complete Works of Hryhorii Skovoroda] - A concordance to Hryhorii Skovoroda\'s complete works (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada)\n* [http://infomotions.com/alex/ Alex Catalogue of Electronic Texts] - The Alex Catalogue is a collection of public domain electronic texts from American and English literature as well as Western philosophy.

S'\'\'\'Search-based applications\'\'\' (\'\'\'SBA\'\'\') are [[software applications]] in which a [[Search engine|search engine platform]] is used as the core infrastructure for information access and reporting. SBAs use [[Semantic technology|semantic technologies]] to aggregate, normalize and classify [[Unstructured data|unstructured]], [[Semi-structured data|semi-structured]] and/or [[Structured data|structured content]] across multiple repositories, and employ [[Natural language processing|natural language technologies]] for accessing the aggregated information.\n\n== Pre-Conditions ==\n\nSearch based applications are fully packaged applications that:<ref>Worldwide Search and Discovery 2009 Vendor Shares: An Update on Market Trends, IDC #223926, July, 2010 by Susan Feldman and Hadley Reynolds.</ref>\n* Are built on a search backbone to enable sub-second access to information in multiple formats and from multiple sources\n* Are delivered as a unified work environment to support a specific task or workflow, for example: eDiscovery, financial services regulatory compliance, fraud detection, voice of the customer, sales prospecting, pharmaceutical research, anti-terrorism intelligence, or customer support.\n* Integrate all the tools that are commonly needed for that specific task or workflow, including:\n** Multi-source information access\n** Authoring\n** Collaboration\n** Business process\n** Reporting and analysis\n** Alerting\n** Visualization\n* Provide pre-configured data integration with multiple repositories of information in multiple formats as appropriate for the application domain.\n* Integrate domain knowledge to support the particular task, including industry taxonomies and vocabularies, internal processes, workflow for the task, connectors to specialized collections of information, and decision heuristics typical of the field.\n* Provide a compelling user interface and interaction design that eliminates the need for users to \xe2\x80\x9cpogo stick\xe2\x80\x9d or continually jump from one application to another. This buffers the user from the complexity of operating separate applications and enables them to focus on getting work done.\n* Are quick to deploy, easy to customize or extend, and economical to administer\n\n== Practical Uses ==\n\nSBAs are used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n* \'\'\' Enterprise Business Applications:\'\'\' For example, [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM), [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP), [[Supply Chain Management]] (SCM), Compliance & Discovery, and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI)\n\n* \'\'\' Web Applications:\'\'\' Typically, B2B, B2C and C2B applications that [[Mashup (digital)|mash-up]] data and functionality from diverse sources (databases, Web content, user-generated content, mapping data and functions, etc.)\n\nThe use of a search platform as the core infrastructure for software applications has been enabled largely by two search engine features:  1) Scalability 2) Ad hoc access to multiple heterogeneous sources from a single point of access.\n\nSearch based applications have proven popular and effective because they provide a dynamic, scalable access infrastructure that can be integrated with other features that information workers need:  task-specific, and easy to use work environments that integrate features that are usually designed to be used as separate applications, collaborative features, domain knowledge, and security.\n\nSearch engines are not a replacement for database systems; they are a complement. They have been optimally engineered to facilitate access to information, not to record and store transactions. In addition, the mathematical and statistical processors integrated to date into search engines remain relatively simple. At present, therefore, databases still provide a more effective structure for complex analytical functions.Search applications also focus on providing quality results considering search relevancy.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further Reading==\n* Worldwide Search and Discovery 2009 Vendor Shares: An Update on Market Trends, IDC #223926, July, 2010 by Susan Feldman and Hadley Reynolds.\n* Butler Group [http://www.butlergroup.com/webinarIntroduction.asp?mcr=EXA190509&scr=EXA190509 Webinar on Search Based Applications] explaining SBA and how they work\n* Presentation on [http://www.informationbuilders.com/support/developers/presentations/?109 Search Based Applications] by   [[Information Builders]]\n* IDC Executive Brief [http://www.exalead.com/software/forms/download.php?resourceid=69 "The Information Advantage: Information Access in Tomorrow\'s Enterprise,"] October 2009, downloadable from the [[Exalead|Exalead.com]] website.

S'{{copy edit|date=October 2013}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2011}}\n\n\'\'\'Search-based software engineering\'\'\' (\'\'\'SBSE\'\'\') is an approach to apply [[metaheuristic]] search techniques like [[genetic algorithms]], [[simulated annealing]] and [[tabu search]] to [[software engineering]] problems. It is inspired by the observation that many activities in [[software engineering]] can be formulated as [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. Due to the [[computational complexity]] of these problems, exact [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques of [[operations research]] like [[linear programming]] or [[dynamic programming]] are mostly impractical for large scale [[software engineering]] problems. Because of this, researchers and practitioners have used [[metaheuristic]] search techniques to find near optimal or good-enough solutions.\n\nBroadly speaking SBSE problems can be divided into two types. The first are black-box optimization problems, for example, assigning people to tasks (a typical [[combinatorial optimization]] problem). \nWith this sort of problem domain, the underlying problem could have come from the software industry, but equally it could have originated from any domain where people are assigned tasks. \nThe second type are white-box problems where operations on source code need to be considered.<ref>\n{{Cite conference\n| doi = 10.1109/SCAM.2010.28\n| conference = 10th IEEE Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2010)\n| pages = 7\xe2\x80\x9319\n| last = Harman\n| first = Mark\n| title = Why Source Code Analysis and Manipulation Will Always be Important\n| booktitle = 10th IEEE Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2010)\n| year = 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe basic idea of SBSE is to take a software engineering problem and convert it into a computational search problem which can be tackled with a [[metaheuristic]]. \nThis essentially involves a number of stages.

Search-based methods have been used for requirements selection and optimisation with the goal of finding the best possible subset of requirements that matches users\' requests and different constraints such as limited resources and interdependencies between requirements. This problem is often tackled as a [[MCDM|multiple-criteria decision-making]] problem and, generally speaking, involves presenting the decision maker with a range of good compromises between cost and user satisfaction.<ref>\n{{Cite thesis\n| type = Ph.D.\n| publisher = University of London\n| last = Zhang\n| first = Yuanyuan\n| title = Multi-Objective Search-based Requirements Selection and Optimisation\n| location = Strand, London, UK\n| date = February 2010\n| url = http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/170695/\n}}</ref>\n<ref>\nY.&nbsp;Zhang and M.&nbsp;Harman and S.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Lim, "[http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fileadmin/UCL-CS/images/Research_Student_Information/RN_11_12.pdf Search Based Optimization of Requirements Interaction Management]," Department of Computer Science, University College London, Research Note RN/11/12, 2011.\n</ref>\n\n===Debugging and maintenance===\n\nIdentifying a [[software bug]] (or a [[code smell]]) and then [[debugging]] (or [[refactoring]]) the software is largely a manual and labor-intensive endeavor, though the process is supported by a number of tools. One objective of SBSE is to automatically identify bugs (for example via [[mutation testing]]), then automatically fix them.\n\n[[Genetic programming]], a biologically-inspired technique which involves evolving programs through the use of crossover and mutation, has been used to search for repairs to programs by altering a few lines of source code. The [http://dijkstra.cs.virginia.edu/genprog/ GenProg Evolutionary Program Repair] software was shown to be able to repair 55 out of 105 bugs for approximately $8 each.<ref>{{Cite conference\n| doi = 10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227211\n| conference = 2012 34th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)\n| pages = 3\xe2\x80\x9313\n| last = Le Goues\n| first = Claire\n| last2 = Dewey-Vogt\n| first2 = Michael\n| last3 = Forrest\n| first3 = Stephanie\n| last4 = Weimer\n| first4 = Westley \n| title = A systematic study of automated program repair: Fixing 55 out of 105 bugs for $8 each\n| booktitle = 2012 34th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)\n| year = 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Coevolution]] has also been used as an approach.

[[Regression testing]] has also received some attention.\n\n===Optimizing software===\nThe use of SBSE in [[program optimization]], or modifying a piece of software to make it more efficient in terms of speed and resource use, has been the object of developing research interest and success.

S'{{for|the adware|Isearch (malware)}}\n\n\'\'\'Isearch\'\'\' is [[open-source software|open-source]] [[text retrieval]] software first developed in 1994 by Nassib Nassar as part of the Isite [[Z39.50]] information framework. The project started at the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) of the North Carolina supercomputing center MCNC and funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] to follow in the track of [[Wide Area Information Server|WAIS]] and develop prototype systems for distributed information networks encompassing Internet applications, library catalogs and other information resources.\n\nThe main features of Isearch include full text and field searching, relevance ranking, Boolean queries, and support for many document types such as HTML, mail folders, list digests, MEDLINE, BibTeX, SGML/XML, FGDC Metadata, NASA DIF, ANZLIC metadata, ISO 19115 metadata and many other resource types and document formats.\n\nIt was the first search engine to be designed from the ground up to support [[SGML]] and ISO [[Z39.50]] search and retrieval. It included many innovations including the "document type" model\xe2\x80\x94which is simply a (object oriented) method of associating each document with a class of functions providing a standard interface for accessing the document. It was one of the first engines (if not the first) to ever support XML.\n\nThe Isearch search/indexing text algorithms were based on [[Gaston Gonnet]]\'s seminal work into PAT arrays and trees for text retrieval--- ideas that were developed for the New Oxford English Dictionary Project at the Univ. of Waterloo, and provided the seeds for [[Tim Bray]]\'s PAT SGML engine that formed the basis of [[Open Text]]. One of the limiting factors, however, of the  Isearch design was that it was not well suited to handle the extremely large data sets that became popular in the mid to late 1990s. In many cases Isearch was adapted or modified to use different algorithms but usually retained the document type model and the architectural relationship with Isite.\n\nIsearch was widely adopted and used in hundreds of public search sites, including  many high profile projects such as the [http://patft1.uspto.gov/ U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent search],[http://clearinghouse3.fgdc.gov/  the Federal Geographic Data Clearinghouse (FGDC)], the NASA Global Change Master Directory, the NASA EOS Guide System, the NASA Catalog Interoperability Project, the Astronomical pre-print service based at the Space Telescope Science Institute, The PCT Electronic Gazette at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Linsearch (a search engine for Open Source Software designed by Miles Efron), the SAGE Project of the Special Collections Department at Emory University, Eco Companion Australasia (an environmental geospatial resources catalog), Australian National Genomic Information Service (ANGIS), the [[Open Directory Project]] and numerous governmental portals in the context of the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) [[United States Government Printing Office|GPO]] mandate (ended in 2005?).\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998 most of the development was centered around the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) in North Carolina (Engine core) and BSn in Germany (Doctypes). By 1998 much of the open-source Isearch core developers re-focused development into several spin-offs. In 1998 it became part of the Advanced Search Facility reference software platform funded by the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nA/WWW Enterprises now maintains the open source version for public usage, supported by paying government clients, such as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, NASA, and the FGDC who have provided support to enhance the functionality and reliability of the software. The software suite is considered a reference implementation of catalog service software.\n\nAs of 2010, the open source version of Isearch is still used on 250+ nodes of FGDC, and by ANZLIC in Australia and selected Geospatial OneStop contributors to facilitate harvesting by GOS, including NOAA, Census Bureau and the Tenn. Field Office of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, among others.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g5e2wfd0lekygvut/ Application of Metadata Concepts to Discovery of Internet Resources]\n*[http://www.springerlink.com/content/b5chmkgx8akg4m2h/ An Operational Metadata Framework for Searching, Indexing, and Retrieving Distributed Geographic Information Services on the Internet]\n* The UNIX Web Server Book, Second Edition, by R.

If \'\'S\'\' is a finite but large set, a combinatorial optimization problem is defined. If <math>{S = R^{n}}</math>, there is continuous optimization model.\n\nA solution <math>{x^* \\in X}</math> is optimal if\n\n<math> {f (x^{*}) \\leq f (x), \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, \\in X} </math>.\n\nExact algorithm for problem (1) is to be found an optimal solution \'\'x*\'\', with the validation of its optimal structure, or if it is unrealizable, in procedure have to be shown that there is no  achievable solution, i.e., <math>X =\\varnothing</math>, or the solution is unbounded. CPU time has to be finite and short. For continuous optimization, it is reasonable to allow for some degree of tolerance, i.e., to stop when a feasible solution <math>x^{*}</math> has been found such that\n\n<math> {f (x^{*}) \\leq f (x) + \\epsilon, \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, \\in X} </math> or\n<math> {(f (x^{*})- f (x))/ f (x^{*})  <  \\epsilon  , \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, \\in X} </math>\n\nSome heuristics speedily accept an approximate solution, or optimal solution but one with no validation of its optimality.\nSome of them have an incorrect certificate, i.e., the solution <math>x_h</math> obtained satisfies\n\n<math> {(f (x_{h})- f (x))/ f (x_{h})  \\leq  \\epsilon  , \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, \\in X} </math>\nfor some <math>\\epsilon</math>, though this is rarely small.\n\nHeuristics are faced with the problem of local optima as a result of avoiding boundless computing time.\nA local optimum <math>x_L</math> of problem is such that\n\n<math> {f (x_{L}) \\leq f (x), \\qquad \\forall{x}\\, \\in N(x_{L}) \\cap X} </math>\n\nwhere <math> N(x_{L})</math>  denotes a neighborhood of <math> x_{L} </math>\n\n== Description ==\nAccording to (Mladenovic, 1995), VNS is a metaheuristic which systematically performs the procedure of neighborhood change, both in descent to local minima and in escape from the valleys which contain them.\n\nVNS is built upon the following perceptions:\n\n# A local minimum with respect to one neighbourhood structure is not necessarily a local minimum for another neighbourhood structure.\n# A global minimum is a local minimum with respect to all possible neighborhood structures.\n# For many problems, local minima with respect to one or several neighborhoods are relatively close to each other.\n\nUnlike many other metaheuristics, the basic schemes of VNS and its extensions are simple and require few, and sometimes no parameters. Therefore, in addition to providing very good solutions, often in simpler ways than other methods, VNS gives insight into the reasons for such a performance, which, in turn, can lead to more efficient and sophisticated implementations.\n\nThere are several papers where it could be studied among recently mentioned, such as (Hansen and Mladenovi\xc2\xb4c 1999, 2001a, 2003, 2005; Moreno-P\xc3\xa9rez et al.;<ref>{{cite journal||last1=Moreno-P\xc3\xa9rez|first1=JA.|last2=Hansen|first2=P. |last3=Mladenovic|first3=N.| title = Parallel variable neighborhood search|journal=Alba E (ed) Parallel metaheuristics: a new class of algorithms|year=2005}}</ref>)\n\n==[[Local search (optimization)|Local search]]==\n\nA local search heuristic is performed through choosing an initial solution x, discovering a direction of descent from x, within a neighbourhood N(x), and proceeding to the minimum of f(x) within N(x) in the same direction. If there is no direction of descent, the heuristic stops; otherwise, it is iterated. Usually the highest direction of descent, also related to as best improvement, is used. This set of rules is summarized in Algorithm 1, where we assume that an initial solution x is given. The output consists of a local minimum, also denoted by x, and its value. Observe that a neighbourhood structure N(x) is defined for all x \xe2\x88\x88 X. At each step, the neighbourhood N(x) of x is explored completely. As this may be timeconsuming, an alternative is to use the first descent heuristic. Vectors <math>x^i \\in N(x)</math> are then enumerated systematically and a move is made as soon as a direction for the descent is found. This is summarized in Algorithm 2.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Best improvement (highest descent) heuristic\n\nFunction BestImprovement(x)\n\n  1: repeat\n  2:     x\' \xe2\x86\x90 x\n  3:     x\xe2\x86\x90argmin_{f (y)}, y\xe2\x88\x88N(x)\n  4: until ( f (x) \xe2\x89\xa5 f (x\'))\n  5: return x\n\nAlgorithm 2 First improvement (first descent) heuristic\n\nFunction FirstImprovement(x)\n\n  1: repeat\n  2:    x\' \xe2\x86\x90 x; i\xe2\x86\x900\n  3:    repeat\n  4:       i\xe2\x86\x90i+1\n  5:       x\xe2\x86\x90argmin{ f (x), f (x^i)}, x^i  \xe2\x88\x88 N(x)\n  6:    until ( f (x) < f (x^i) or i = |N(x)|)\n  7: until ( f (x) \xe2\x89\xa5 f (x\'))\n  8: return x\n\nLet one denote <math> \\mathcal{ N}_k(k=1, . . . ,k_{max}) </math>, a finite set of pre-selected neighborhood structures, and with <math>\\mathcal{N}_k(x)</math> the set of solutions in the \'\'kth\'\' neighborhood of \'\'x\'\'.\n\nOne will also use the notation <math>\\mathcal{N\'}_k(x), k = 1, . . . , k\'_{max} </math> when describing local descent. Neighborhoods <math>\\mathcal{N}_k(x)</math> or <math>\\mathcal{N\'}_k(x)</math> may be induced from one or more [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] (or quasi-metric) functions introduced into a solution space \'\'S\'\'.\nAn optimal solution <math>x_{opt}</math> (or [[maxima and minima|global minimum]]) is a feasible solution where a minimum of problem ( is reached. We call \'\'x\' \xe2\x88\x88 X\'\' a local minimum of problem with respect to <math>\\mathcal{N}_k(x) </math>, if there is no solution <math> x \\in \\mathcal{N\'}_k(x) \\subseteq X </math> such that <math>f (x) < f (x\')</math>.\n\nIn order to solve problem by using several neighbourhoods, facts 1\xe2\x80\x933 can be used in three different ways: (i) deterministic; (ii) [[stochastic]]; (iii) both deterministic and stochastic. We first give in Algorithm 3 the steps of the neighbourhood change function which will be used later. Function NeighbourhoodChange() compares the new value f(x\') with the incumbent value f(x) obtained in the neighbourhood k (line 1). If an improvement is obtained, k is returned to its initial value and the new incumbent updated (line 2). Otherwise, the next neighbourhood is considered (line 3).\n\nAlgorithm 3&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Neighborhood change\n\nFunction NeighborhoodChange (x, x\', k)\n\n<code>\n 1: if f (x\') < f(x) then\n 2:    x \xe2\x86\x90 x\' // Make a move\n 3:    k \xe2\x86\x90 1 // Initial neighborhood\n 4: else\n 5:    k \xe2\x86\x90 k+1 // Next neighborhood\n\n</code>\n\nWhen VNS does not render good solution, there are several steps which could be helped in process, such as comparing first and best improvement strategies in local search, reducing neighborhood, intensifying shaking, adopting VND, adopting FSS, and experimenting with parameter settings.\n\nThe Basic VNS (BVNS) method (Mladenovic and Hansen 1997) combines deterministic and stochastic changes of neighbourhood. Its steps are given in Algorithm 4. Often successive neighbourhoods <math> \\mathcal{N}_k</math> will be nested. Observe that point x\' is generated at random in Step 4 in order to avoid cycling, which might occur if a deterministic rule were applied. In Step 5, the first improvement local search (Algorithm 2) is usually\nadopted. However, it can be replaced with best improvement (Algorithm 1).\n\nAlgorithm 4: Basic VNS\n\nFunction VNS (x, kmax, tmax );\n\n<code>\n\n 1: repeat\n 2:    k \xe2\x86\x90 1;\n 3:    repeat\n 4:       x\' \xe2\x86\x90Shake(x, k) /* Shaking */;\n 5:       x\'\' \xe2\x86\x90 FirstImprovement(x\' ) /* Local search */;\n 6:       NeighbourhoodChange(x, x\', k) /* Change neighbourhood */;\n 7:    until k = k_max ;\n 8:    t \xe2\x86\x90CpuTime()\n 9: until t > t_max ;\n\n</code>\n\nThe basic VNS is a first improvement [[method of steepest descent|descent method]] with randomization. Without much additional effort, it can be transformed into a descent-ascent method: in NeighbourhoodChange() function, replace also x by x" with some probability, even if the solution is worse than the incumbent. It can also be changed into a best improvement method: make a move to the best neighbourhood k* among all k_max of them.\nAnother variant of the basic VNS can be to find a solution x\' in the \xe2\x80\x9cShaking\xe2\x80\x9d step as the best among b (a parameter) randomly generated solutions from the \'\'k\'\'th neighbourhood. There are two possible variants of this extension: (1) to perform only one local search from the best among b points; (2) to perform all b local searches and then choose the best.

Rather, the :values of these new points are compared with that of the incumbent and an update takes place in case of improvement. It is assumed that a :stopping condition has been chosen like the maximum [[CPU time]] allowed <math>t_{max}</math> or the maximum number of iterations :between two improvements.\n:To simplify the description of the algorithms it is used <math>t_{max}</math> below. Therefore, RVNS uses two parameters: <math>t_{max}</math> :and <math>k_{max}</math>. RVNS is useful in very large instances, for which local search is costly. It has been observed that the best value for :the parameter k_max is often 2. In addition, the maximum number of iterations between two improvements is usually used as a stopping condition. :RVNS is akin to a [[Monte-Carlo method]], but is more systematic.\n* Skewed VNS\n:The skewed VNS (SVNS) method (Hansen et al.)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=P.|last2=Jaumard|first2=B|last3=Mladenovi\xc2\xb4c|first3=N|last4=Parreira |first4=A |title=Variable neighborhood search :for weighted maximum satisfiability problem|journal=Les Cahiers du GERAD G\xe2\x80\x932000\xe2\x80\x9362, HEC Montr\xc3\xa9al, Canada|year=2000}}</ref> addresses the :problem of exploring valleys far from the incumbent solution. Indeed, once the best solution in a large region has been found, it is necessary to :go some way to obtain an improved one. Solutions drawn at random in distant neighbourhoods may differ substantially from the incumbent and VNS :can then degenerate, to some extent, into the Multistart heuristic (in which descents are made iteratively from solutions generated at random, a :heuristic which is known not to be very efficient). Consequently, some compensation for distance from the incumbent must be made.\n* Variable Neighbourhood Decomposition Search\n:The variable neighbourhood decomposition search (VNDS) method (Hansen et al.)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=P|last2=Mladenovi\xc2\xb4c|first2=N|last3=P\xc3\xa9rez-Brito|first3=D |title=Variable neighborhood decomposition :search|journal=J Heuristics|year=2001|volume=7|issue=4|pages=335\xe2\x80\x93350}}</ref> extends the basic VNS into a two-level VNS scheme based upon :decomposition of the problem.

Guaranteed :performance of the primal heuristic may be determined if a [[upper and lower bounds|lower bound]] on the objective function value is known. To :this end, the standard approach is to relax the integrality condition on the primal variables, based on a mathematical programming formulation of :the problem.\n:However, when the dimension of the problem is large, even the relaxed problem may be impossible to solve exactly by standard :commercial solvers. :Therefore, it seems a good idea to solve dual relaxed problems heuristically as well.

S'{{mergeto|Faceted classification|date=January 2015}}\n\'\'\'Faceted search\'\'\', also called \'\'\'faceted navigation\'\'\' or \'\'\'faceted browsing\'\'\', is a technique for accessing information organized according to a [[faceted classification]] system, allowing users to explore a collection of information by applying multiple filters. A faceted classification system classifies each information element along multiple explicit dimensions, called facets, enabling the classifications to be accessed and ordered in multiple ways rather than in a single, pre-determined, [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] order.<ref name="Faceted Search">[http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00190ED1V01Y200904ICR005 Faceted Search], Morgan & Claypool, 2009</ref>\n\nFacets correspond to properties of the information elements. They are often derived by analysis of the text of an item using [[entity extraction]] techniques or from pre-existing fields in a database such as author, descriptor, language, and format. Thus, existing web-pages, product descriptions or online collections of articles can be augmented with navigational facets.\n\nWithin the academic community, faceted search has attracted interest primarily among [[library and information science]] researchers, and to some extent among [[computer science]] researchers specializing in [[information retrieval]].{{fact|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Development==\n\nThe [[Association for Computing Machinery]]\'s [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval]] provided the following description of the role of faceted search for a 2006 workshop:\n<blockquote>\nThe web search world, since its very beginning, has offered two paradigms:\n*Navigational search uses a hierarchy structure (taxonomy) to enable users to browse the information space by iteratively narrowing the scope of their quest in a predetermined order, as exemplified by [[Yahoo! Directory]], [[Open Directory Project|DMOZ]], etc.\n*Direct search allows users to simply write their queries as a bag of words in a text box. This approach has been made enormously popular by [[Web search engine]]s. \nOver the last few years, the direct search paradigm has gained dominance and the navigational approach became less and less popular. Recently, a new approach has emerged, combining both paradigms, namely the faceted search approach. Faceted search enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space by combining text search with a progressive narrowing of choices in each dimension. It has become the prevailing user interaction mechanism in e-commerce sites and is being extended to deal with [[semi-structured data]], continuous dimensions, and [[Folksonomy | folksonomies]].<ref name="sigir06">[http://facetedsearch.googlepages.com SIGIR\'2006 Workshop on Faceted Search - Call for Participation]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Technology==\n\nVarious search engine software supports faceted classification.\n\n* [[Apache Lucene]] and derived software:\n**  [[Apache Solr]]\n** [[Swiftype]]\n** [[Elasticsearch]]\n* A number of major vendors listed at [[Comparison of enterprise search software#Faceted_Navigation]]\n* [[Dieselpoint]]\n* [[Endeca]]\n* iSeek, search engine for general web and education<ref>[http://www.iseek.com iSeek]</ref>\n* [[SpeedTrack]]<ref>http://www.speedtrack.com/technology</ref>\n* XSEARCH<ref>[http://www.weitkamper.com]</ref>\n\n==Mass market use==\n\nFaceted search has become a popular technique in commercial search applications, particularly for online retailers and libraries. An increasing number of [[List of Enterprise Search Vendors|enterprise search vendors]] such as [[Swiftype]] provide software for implementing faceted search applications.\n\nOnline retail catalogs pioneered the earliest applications of faceted search, reflecting both the faceted nature of product data (most products have a type, brand, price, etc.) and the ready availability of the data in retailers\' existing information-systems. In the early 2000s retailers started using faceted search. A 2014 benchmark of 50 of the largest US based online retailers reveals that despite the benefits of faceted search, only 40% of the sites have implemented it. <ref name="Smashing Magazine: The Current State of E-Commerce Search (2014)">[http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/18/the-current-state-of-e-commerce-search/ Smashing Magazine: The Current State of E-Commerce Search] Retrieved on 2014-08-27.</ref> Examples include the filtering options that appear in the left column on [[amazon.com]] or [[Google Shopping]] after a keyword search has been performed.\n\n==Libraries and information science==\n\n\n\n\nIn 1933, the noted librarian [[S. R. Ranganathan|Ranganathan]] proposed a [[faceted classification]] system for library materials, known as [[colon classification]]. In the pre-computer era, he did not succeed in replacing the pre-coordinated [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] system.<ref name="Major classification systems : the Dewey Centennial">[http://archive.org/details/majorclassificat00alle Major classification systems : the Dewey Centennial]</ref>\n\nModern online library catalogs, also known as [[OPAC]]s, have increasingly adopted faceted search interfaces. Noted examples include the [[North Carolina State University]] library catalog (part of the Triangle Research Libraries Network) and the [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]] Open [[WorldCat]] system.\n\nInfoHarness<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shklar|first1=Leon|last2=Thatte|first2=Satish|last3=Marcus|first3=Howard|last4=Sheth|first4=Amit|title=The "InfoHarness" Information Integration Platform|journal=Proceedings of the Second International Conference on the World Wide Web|date=1994|url=http://citeseer.uark.edu:8080/citeseerx/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.4042|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shklar|first1=Leon|last2=Sheth|first2=Amit|last3=Kashyap|first3=Vipul|last4=Shah|first4=Kshitij|title=InfoHarness: Use of automatically generated metadata for search and retrieval of heterogeneous information|journal=Advanced Information Systems Engineering|date=20 July 2005|doi=10.1007/3-540-59498-1_248|url=http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-59498-1_248|accessdate=5 January 2015|ref=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.23.7442}}</ref> is one of the first Web System (developed in 1994) that provided faceted search over heterogeneous information artifacts such as Web pages, images, videos and documents.

If <math>i < j</math> and <math>A(i) > A(j)</math>, then the pair <math>(i, j)</math> is called an inversion of <math>A</math>.{{sfn|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2001|pp=39}}{{sfn|Vitter|Flajolet|1990|pp=459}}\n\nThe \'\'\'inversion number\'\'\' of a sequence is one common measure of its sortedness.{{sfn|Barth|Mutzel|2004|pp=183}}{{sfn|Vitter|Flajolet|1990|pp=459}}  Formally, the inversion number is defined to be the number of inversions, that is, \n:<math>\\text{inv}(A) = \\# \\{(A(i),A(j)) \\mid i < j \\text{ and } A(i) > A(j)\\}</math>.{{sfn|Barth|Mutzel|2004|pp=183}}  \nOther measures of (pre-)sortedness include the minimum number of elements that can be deleted from the sequence to yield a fully sorted sequence, the number and lengths of sorted "runs" within the sequence, and the smallest number of exchanges needed to sort the sequence.{{sfn|Mahmoud|2000|pp=284}} Standard [[comparison sort]]ing algorithms can be adapted to compute the inversion number in time {{math|O(\'\'n\'\' log \'\'n\'\')}}.\n\nThe \'\'\'inversion vector\'\'\' \'\'V(i)\'\' of the sequence is defined for \'\'i\'\' = 2, ..., \'\'n\'\' as <math>V[i] = \\left\\vert\\{k \\mid k < i \\text{ and } A(k) > A(i)\\}\\right\\vert</math>.  In other words each element is the number of elements preceding the element in the original sequence that are greater than it.  Note that the inversion vector of a sequence has one less element than the sequence, because of course the number of preceding elements that are greater than the first is always zero.  Each permutation of a sequence has a unique inversion vector and it is possible to construct any given permutation of a (fully sorted) sequence from that sequence and the permutation\'s inversion vector.{{sfn|Pemmaraju|Skiena|2003|pp=69}}\n\n==Weak order of permutations==\nThe set of permutations on \'\'n\'\' items can be given the structure of a [[partial order]], called the \'\'\'weak order of permutations\'\'\', which forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].\n\nTo define this order, consider the items being permuted to be the integers from 1 to \'\'n\'\', and let Inv(\'\'u\'\') denote the set of inversions of a permutation \'\'u\'\' for the natural ordering on these items. That is, Inv(\'\'u\'\') is the set of ordered pairs (\'\'i\'\', \'\'j\'\') such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 \'\'i\'\' < \'\'j\'\' \xe2\x89\xa4 \'\'n\'\' and \'\'u\'\'(\'\'i\'\') > \'\'u\'\'(\'\'j\'\'). Then, in the weak order, we define \'\'u\'\' \xe2\x89\xa4 \'\'v\'\' whenever Inv(\'\'u\'\') \xe2\x8a\x86 Inv(\'\'v\'\').\n\nThe edges of the [[Hasse diagram]] of the weak order are given by permutations \'\'u\'\' and \'\'v\'\' such that \'\'u < v\'\' and such that \'\'v\'\' is obtained from \'\'u\'\' by interchanging two consecutive values of \'\'u\'\'. These edges form a [[Cayley graph]] for the [[symmetric group|group of permutations]] that is isomorphic to the [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a [[permutohedron]].\n\nThe identity permutation is the minimum element of the weak order, and the permutation formed by reversing the identity is the maximum element.\n\n== See also ==\n{{wikiversity|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n{{commons|Category:Inversion (discrete mathematics)|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n* [[Factorial number system]] (a factorial number is a reflected inversion vector)\n* [[Permutation group#Transpositions, simple transpositions, inversions and sorting|Transpositions, simple transpositions, inversions and sorting]]\n* [[Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance]]\n* [[Parity of a permutation]]\n\n\'\'\'Sequences in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]:\'\'\'\n* [https://oeis.org/wiki/Index_to_OEIS:_Section_Fa#factorial Index entries for sequences related to factorial numbers]\n* Reflected inversion vectors: {{OEIS link|A007623}} and {{OEIS link|A108731}}\n* Sum of inversion vectors, cardinality of inversion sets: {{OEIS link|A034968}}\n* Inversion sets of finite permutations interpreted as binary numbers: {{OEIS link|A211362}} &nbsp; (related permutation: {{OEIS link|A211363}})\n* Finite permutations that have only 0s and 1s in their inversion vectors: {{OEIS link|A059590}} &nbsp; (their inversion sets: {{OEIS link|A211364}})\n* Numbers of permutations of n elements with k inversions; Mahonian numbers: {{OEIS link|A008302}} &nbsp; (their row maxima; Kendall-Mann numbers: {{OEIS link|A000140}})\n* Number of connected labeled graphs with n edges and n nodes: {{OEIS link|A057500}}\n* Arrays of permutations with similar inversion sets and inversion vectors: {{OEIS link|A211365}}, {{OEIS link|A211366}}, {{OEIS link|A211367}}, {{OEIS link|A211368}}, {{OEIS link|A211369}}, {{OEIS link|A100630}}, {{OEIS link|A211370}}, {{OEIS link|A051683}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|4|refs=}}\n\n=== Source bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|1}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Barth|first2=Petra|last2=Mutzel|author2-link=Petra Mutzel|title=Simple and Efficient Bilayer Cross Counting|journal=[[Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications]]|volume=8|issue=2|pages=179&ndash;194|year=2004|doi=10.7155/jgaa.00088}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv\n | first1=Thomas H.|last1=Cormen|authorlink1=Thomas H.

Necessary requirement for a string \'\'metric\'\' (e.g. in contrast to [[string matching]]) is fulfillment of the [[triangle inequality]]. For example the strings "Sam" and "Samuel" can be considered to be close. A string metric provides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of distance.\n\nThe most widely known string metric is a rudimentary one called the [[Levenshtein distance|Levenshtein Distance]] (also known as Edit Distance).  It operates between two input strings, returning a number equivalent to the number of substitutions and deletions needed in order to transform one input string into another. Simplistic string metrics such as [[Levenshtein distance]] have expanded to include phonetic, [[token (parser)|token]], grammatical and character-based methods of statistical comparisons.\n\nA widespread example of a string metric is [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]] and RNA analysis, which are performed by optimized string metrics to identify matching sequences.\n\nString metrics are used heavily in [[information integration]] and are currently used in areas including [[Data analysis techniques for fraud detection|fraud detection]], [[fingerprint analysis]], [[plagiarism detection]], [[ontology merging]], [[DNA analysis]], RNA analysis, [[image analysis]], evidence-based machine learning, [[database]] [[data deduplication]], [[data mining]], Web interfaces, e.g. [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]-style suggestions as you type, [[data integration]], and semantic [[knowledge integration]].\n\n==List of string metrics==\n\n<!-- This can be a separate article, someday. -->\n* [[S\xc3\xb8rensen\xe2\x80\x93Dice coefficient]]\n* [[Hamming distance]]\n* [[Levenshtein distance]] and [[Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance]]\n* [[Block distance]] or [[L1 distance]] or [[City block distance]]\n* [[Simple matching coefficient]] (SMC)\n* [[Jaccard similarity]] or [[Jaccard coefficient]] or [[Tanimoto coefficient]]\n* [[Most frequent k characters]]\n* [[Tversky index]]\n* [[Overlap coefficient]]\n* [[Variational distance]]\n* [[Hellinger distance]] or [[Bhattacharyya distance]]\n* [[Information radius]] ([[Jensen\xe2\x80\x93Shannon divergence]])\n* [[Skew divergence]]\n* [[Confusion probability]]\n* [[Kendall_tau_distance|Tau metric]], an approximation of the [[Kullback\xe2\x80\x93Leibler divergence]]\n* [[Fellegi and Sunters metric]] (SFS)\n* [[Maximal matches]]\n* [[Lee distance]]\n\n==Selected string measures examples==\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n|-\n!

S'In [[computer science]], \'\'\'edit distance\'\'\' is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two [[String (computing)|strings]] (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. Edit distances find applications in [[natural language processing]], where automatic [[Spell checker|spelling correction]] can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question. In [[bioinformatics]], it can be used to quantify the similarity of [[macromolecule]]s such as [[DNA]], which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T.\n\nSeveral definitions of edit distance exist, using different sets of string operations. One of the most common variants is called [[Levenshtein distance]], named after the Soviet Russian computer scientist [[Vladimir Levenshtein]]. In this version, the allowed operations are the removal or insertion of a single character, or the substitution of one character for another. Levenshtein distance may also simply be called "edit distance", although several variants exist.<ref name="navarro">{{Cite doi/10.1145.2F375360.375365}}</ref>{{rp|32}}\n\n==Formal definition and properties==\nGiven two strings {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} on an alphabet {{mvar|\xce\xa3}} (e.g. the set of [[ASCII]] characters, the set of [[byte]]s [0..255], etc.), the edit distance d({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}) is the minimum-weight series of edit operations that transforms {{mvar|a}} into {{mvar|b}}. One of the simplest sets of edit operations is that defined by Levenshtein in 1966:<ref name="slp"/>\n\n:\'\'\'Insertion\'\'\' of a single symbol. If {{mvar|a}} = {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|v}}, then inserting the symbol {{mvar|x}} produces {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|x}}{{mvar|v}}. This can also be denoted \xce\xb5\xe2\x86\x92{{mvar|x}}, using \xce\xb5 to denote the empty string.\n:\'\'\'Deletion\'\'\' of a single symbol changes {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|x}}{{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|v}} ({{mvar|x}}\xe2\x86\x92\xce\xb5).\n:\'\'\'Substitution\'\'\' of a single symbol {{mvar|x}} for a symbol {{mvar|y}} \xe2\x89\xa0 {{mvar|x}} changes {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|x}}{{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|y}}{{mvar|v}} ({{mvar|x}}\xe2\x86\x92{{mvar|y}}).\n\nIn Levenshtein\'s original definition, each of these operations has unit cost (except that substitution of a character by itself has zero cost), so the Levenshtein distance is equal to the minimum \'\'number\'\' of operations required to transform {{mvar|a}} to {{mvar|b}}. A more general definition associates non-negative weight functions {{mvar|w}}<sub>ins</sub>({{mvar|x}}), {{mvar|w}}<sub>del</sub>({{mvar|x}}) and {{mvar|w}}<sub>sub</sub>({{mvar|x}}&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}) with the operations.<ref name="slp">{{cite book |author1=Daniel Jurafsky |author2=James H. Martin |title=Speech and Language Processing |publisher=Pearson Education International |pages=107\xe2\x80\x93111}}</ref>\n\nAdditional primitive operations have been suggested. A common mistake when typing text is \'\'\'transposition\'\'\' of two adjacent characters commonly occur, formally characterized by an operation that changes {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|x}}{{mvar|y}}{{mvar|v}} into {{mvar|u}}{{mvar|y}}{{mvar|x}}{{mvar|v}} where {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} \xe2\x88\x88 {{mvar|\xce\xa3}}.<ref name="ukkonen83">{{cite conference |author=Esko Ukkonen |title=On approximate string matching |conference=Foundations of Computation Theory |year=1983 |pages=487\xe2\x80\x93495 |publisher=Springer}}</ref><ref name="ssm"/>\nFor the task of correcting [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] output, \'\'\'merge\'\'\' and \'\'\'split\'\'\' operations have been used which replace a single character into a pair of them or vice-versa.<ref name="ssm">{{cite journal |first1=Klaus U. |last1=Schulz |first2=Stoyan |last2=Mihov |year=2002 |id={{citeseerx|10.1.1.16.652}} |title=Fast string correction with Levenshtein automata |journal=International Journal of Document Analysis and Recognition |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=67\xe2\x80\x9385 |doi=10.1007/s10032-002-0082-8}}</ref>\n\nOther variants of edit distance are obtained by restricting the set of operations. [[Longest common subsequence]] (LCS) distance is edit distance with insertion and deletion as the only two edit operations, both at unit cost.<ref name="navarro"/>{{rp|37}} Similarly, by only allowing substitutions (again at unit cost), [[Hamming distance]] is obtained; this must be restricted to equal-length strings.<ref name="navarro"/>\n[[Jaro\xe2\x80\x93Winkler distance]] can be obtained from an edit distance where only transpositions are allowed.\n\n===Example===\nThe [[Levenshtein distance]] between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3. The minimal edit script that transforms the former into the latter is:\n\n# \'\'\'k\'\'\'itten \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'s\'\'\'itten (substitution of "s" for "k")\n# sitt\'\'\'e\'\'\'n \xe2\x86\x92 sitt\'\'\'i\'\'\'n (substitution of "i" for "e")\n# sittin \xe2\x86\x92 sittin\'\'\'g\'\'\' (insertion of "g" at the end).\n\nLCS distance (insertions and deletions only) gives a different distance and minimal edit script:\n\n# delete \'\'\'k\'\'\' at 0\n# insert \'\'\'s\'\'\' at 0\n# delete \'\'\'e\'\'\' at 4\n# insert \'\'\'i\'\'\' at 4\n# insert \'\'\'g\'\'\' at 6\n\nfor a total cost/distance of 5 operations.\n\n===Properties===\nEdit distance with non-negative cost satisfies the axioms of a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], giving rise to a [[metric space]] of strings, when the following conditions are met:<ref name="navarro"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n* Every edit operation has positive cost;\n* for every operation, there is an inverse operation with equal cost.\n\nWith these properties, the metric axioms are satisfied as follows:\n\n:{{mvar|d}}({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|a}}) = 0, since each string can be trivially transformed to itself using exactly zero operations.\n:{{mvar|d}}({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}) > 0 when {{mvar|a}} \xe2\x89\xa0 {{mvar|b}}, since this would require at least one operation at non-zero cost.\n:{{mvar|d}}({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}) = {{mvar|d}}({{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|a}}) by equality of the cost of each operation and its inverse.\n:Triangle inequality: {{mvar|d}}({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|c}}) \xe2\x89\xa4 {{mvar|d}}({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}) + {{mvar|d}}({{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}).<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Lei Chen |author2=Raymond Ng |title=On the marriage of L\xe2\x82\x9a-norms and edit distance |conference=Proc. 30th Int\'l Conf. on Very Large Databases (VLDB) |volume=30 |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLevenshtein distance and LCS distance with unit cost satisfy the above conditions, and therefore the metric axioms. Variants of edit distance that are not proper metrics have also been considered in the literature.<ref name="navarro"/>\n\nOther useful properties of unit-cost edit distances include:\n\n* LCS distance is bounded above by the sum of lengths of a pair of strings.<ref name="navarro"/>{{rp|37}}\n* LCS distance is an upper bound on Levenshtein distance.\n* For strings of the same length, Hamming distance is an upper bound on Levenshtein distance.<ref name="navarro"/>\n\nRegardless of cost/weights, the following property holds of all edit distances:\n\n* When {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} share a common prefix, this prefix has no effect on the distance. Formally, when {{mvar|a}} = {{mvar|uv}} and {{mvar|b}} = {{mvar|uw}}, then {{mvar|d}}({{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}) = {{mvar|d}}({{mvar|v}}, {{mvar|w}}).<ref name="ssm"/> This allows speeding up many computations involving edit distance and edit scripts, since common prefixes and suffixes can be skipped in linear time.\n\n==Computation==\n===Basic algorithm===\n{{main|Wagner\xe2\x80\x93Fischer algorithm}}\nUsing Levenshtein\'s original operations, the edit distance between <math>a = a_1\\ldots a_n</math> and <math>b = b_1\\ldots b_m</math> is given by <math>d_{mn}</math>, defined by the recurrence<ref name="slp"/>\n\n:<math>d_{i0} = \\sum_{k=1}^{i} w_\\mathrm{del}(b_{k}), \\quad  for\\; 1 \\leq i \\leq m</math>\n:<math>d_{0j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{j} w_\\mathrm{ins}(a_{k}), \\quad  for\\; 1 \\leq j \\leq n</math>\n:<math>d_{ij} = \\begin{cases} d_{i-1, j-1} & \\quad a_{j} = b_{i}\\\\ \\min \\begin{cases} d_{i-1, j} + w_\\mathrm{del}(b_{i})\\\\ d_{i,j-1} + w_\\mathrm{ins}(a_{j}) \\\\ d_{i-1,j-1} + w_\\mathrm{sub}(a_{j}, b_{i}) \\end{cases} & \\quad a_{j} \\neq b_{i}\\end{cases} , \\quad  for\\; 1 \\leq i \\leq m, 1 \\leq j \\leq n.</math>\n\nThis algorithm can be generalized to handle transpositions by adding another term in the recursive clause\'s minimization.<ref name="ukkonen83"/>\n\nThe straightforward, [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] way of evaluating this recurrence takes [[exponential time]].

It achieves this by only computing and storing a part of the dynamic programming table around its diagonal. This algorithm takes time O({{mvar|s}}\xc3\x97min({{mvar|m}},{{mvar|n}})), where {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are the lengths of the strings.

S'{{context|date=June 2012}}\nThe \'\'\'Binary Independence Model\'\'\' (BIM)<ref name="cyu76" /><ref name="jones77"/> is a probabilistic [[information retrieval]] technique that makes some simple assumptions to make the estimation of document/query similarity probability feasible.\n\n==Definitions==\nThe Binary Independence Assumption is that documents are [[bit array|binary vector]]s. That is, only the presence or absence of terms in documents are recorded. Terms are [[independence (probability theory)|independently]] distributed in the set of relevant documents and they are also independently distributed in the set of irrelevant documents.\nThe representation is an ordered set of [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] variables. That is, the representation of a document or query is a vector with one Boolean element for each term under consideration. More specifically, a document is represented by a vector \'\'d = (x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>m</sub>)\'\' where \'\'x<sub>t</sub>=1\'\' if term \'\'t\'\' is present in the document \'\'d\'\' and \'\'x<sub>t</sub>=0\'\' if it\'s not. Many documents can have the same vector representation with this simplification. Queries are represented in a similar way.\n"Independence" signifies that terms in the document are considered independently from each other and  no association between terms is modeled. This assumption is very limiting, but it has been shown that it gives good enough results for many situations. This independence is the "naive" assumption of a [[Naive Bayes classifier]], where properties that imply each other are nonetheless treated as independent for the sake of simplicity. This assumption allows the representation to be treated as an instance of a [[Vector space model]] by considering each term as a value of 0 or 1 along a dimension orthogonal to the dimensions used for the other terms.\n\nThe probability \'\'P(R|d,q)\'\' that a document is relevant derives from the probability of relevance of the terms vector of that document \'\'P(R|x,q)\'\'. By using the [[Bayes rule]] we get:\n\n<math>P(R|x,q) = \\frac{P(x|R,q)*P(R|q)}{P(x|q)}</math>\n\nwhere \'\'P(x|R=1,q)\'\' and \'\'P(x|R=0,q)\'\' are the probabilities of retrieving a relevant or nonrelevant document, respectively. If so, then that document\'s representation is \'\'x\'\'.\nThe exact probabilities can not be known beforehand, so use estimates from statistics about the collection of documents must be used.\n\n\'\'P(R=1|q)\'\' and \'\'P(R=0|q)\'\' indicate the previous probability of retrieving a relevant or nonrelevant document respectively for a query \'\'q\'\'. If, for instance, we knew the percentage of relevant documents in the collection, then we could use it to estimate these probabilities.\nSince a document is either relevant or nonrelevant to a query we have that:\n\n<math>P(R=1|x,q) + P(R=0|x,q) = 1</math>\n\n=== Query Terms Weighting ===\nGiven a binary query and the [[dot product]] as the similarity function between a document and a query, the problem is to assign weights to the\nterms in the query such that the retrieval effectiveness will be high. Let <math>p_i</math> and <math>q_i</math> be the probability that a relevant document and an irrelevant document has the <math>i^{th}</math> term respectively. Yu and [[Gerard Salton|Salton]],<ref name="cyu76" /> who first introduce BIM, propose that the weight of the <math>i^{th}</math> term is an increasing function of <math>Y_i =  \\frac{p_i *(1-q_i)}{(1-p_i)*q_i}</math>. Thus, if <math>Y_i</math> is higher than <math>Y_j</math>, the weight\nof term <math>i</math> will be higher than that of term <math>j</math>. Yu and Salton<ref name="cyu76" /> showed that such a weight assignment to query terms yields better retrieval effectiveness than if query terms are equally weighted. [[Stephen Robertson (computer scientist)|Robertson]] and [[Karen Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones|Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones]]<ref name="jones77"/> later showed that if the <math>i^{th}</math> term is assigned the weight of <math>log Y_i</math>, then optimal retrieval effectiveness is obtained under the Binary Independence Assumption.\n\nThe Binary Independence Model was introduced by Yu and Salton.<ref name="cyu76" /> The name Binary Independence Model was coined by Robertson and Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones.<ref name="jones77"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bag of words model]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation | url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/irbook.html | title=Introduction to Information Retrieval | author=Christopher D.

String kernels can be intuitively understood as functions measuring the similarity of pairs of strings: the more similar two strings \'\'a\'\' and \'\'b\'\' are, the higher the value of a string kernel \'\'K\'\'(\'\'a\'\', \'\'b\'\') will be.\n\nUsing string kernels with [[Kernel trick|kernelized]] learning algorithms such as [[support vector machine]]s allow such algorithms to work with strings, without having to translate these to fixed-length, real-valued [[feature vector]]s.<ref name="Lodhi"/> String kernels are used in domains where sequence data are to be [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] or [[statistical classification|classified]], e.g. in [[text mining]] and [[bioinformatics|gene analysis]].<ref>\n{{Citation\n  | title = The spectrum kernel: A string kernel for SVM protein classification\n  | last = Leslie\n  | first = C.\n  | last2 = Eskin\n  | first2 = E.\n  | last3 = Noble\n  | first3 = W.S.\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing\n  | volume = 7\n  | pages = 566\xe2\x80\x93575\n  | year = 2002\n}}</ref>\n\n==Informal introduction==\n\nSuppose one wants to compare some text passages automatically and indicate their relative similarity.\nFor many applications, it might be sufficient to find some keywords which match exactly.\nOne example where exact matching is not always enough is found in [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] detection.<ref>\n{{Citation\n  | title = Improved Online Support Vector Machines Spam Filtering Using String Kernels\n  | last = Amayri\n  | first = O.\n}}</ref>\nAnother would be in computational gene analysis, where [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[genes]] have [[mutated]], resulting in common subsequences along with deleted, inserted or replaced symbols.\n<!--- TODO insert a picture here --->\n\n==Motivation==\n\nSince several well-proven data clustering, classification and information retrieval\n<!--- and other ... see manifold learning --->\nmethods (for example support vector machines) are designed to work on vectors\n(i.e. data are elements of a vector space), using a string kernel allows the extension of these methods to handle sequence data.\n\nThe string kernel method is to be contrasted with earlier approaches for text classification where feature vectors only indicated\nthe presence or absence of a word.\nNot only does it improve on these approaches, but it is an example for a whole class of kernels adapted to data structures, which\nbegan to appear at the turn of the 21st century.

S'In [[computer science]], the \'\'\'Wagner\xe2\x80\x93Fischer algorithm\'\'\' is a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm that computes the [[edit distance]] between two strings of characters.\n\n==History==\nThe Wagner\xe2\x80\x93Fischer algorithm has a history of [[multiple invention]]. Navarro lists the following inventors of it, with date of publication, and acknowledges that the list is incomplete:<ref name="navarro"/>{{rp|43}}\n* Vintsyuk, 1968\n* [[Needleman\xe2\x80\x93Wunsch algorithm|Needleman and Wunsch]], 1970\n* Sankoff, 1972\n* Sellers, 1974\n* Wagner and Fischer, 1974\n* Lowrance and Wagner, 1975\n\n==Calculating distance==\nThe Wagner\xe2\x80\x93Fischer algorithm computes edit distance based on the observation that if we reserve a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to hold the edit distances between all [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]]es of the first string and all prefixes of the second, then we can compute the values in the matrix by [[flood fill]]ing the matrix, and thus find the distance between the two full strings as the last value computed.\n\nA straightforward implementation, as [[pseudocode]] for a function \'\'EditDistance\'\' that takes two strings, \'\'s\'\' of length \'\'m\'\', and \'\'t\'\' of length \'\'n\'\', and returns the Levenshtein distance between them, looks as follows. Note that the inputs strings are one-indexed, while the matrix \'\'d\'\' is zero-indexed, and <code>[i..k]</code> is a closed range.\n\n  \'\'\'int\'\'\' EditDistance(\'\'\'char\'\'\' s[1..m], \'\'\'char\'\'\' t[1..n])\n    \'\'// For all i and j, d[i,j] will hold the Levenshtein distance between\'\'\n    \'\'// the first i characters of s and the first j characters of t.\'\'\n    \'\'// Note that d has (m+1)  x(n+1) values.\n    \'\'\'let\'\'\' d be a 2-d array of \'\'\'int\'\'\' with dimensions [0..m, 0..n]\n   \n    \'\'\'for\'\'\' i \'\'\'in\'\'\' [0..m]\n      d[i, 0] \xe2\x86\x90 i \'\'// the distance of any first string to an empty second string\'\'\n    \'\'\'for\'\'\' j \'\'\'in\'\'\' [0..n]\n      d[0, j] \xe2\x86\x90 j \'\'// the distance of any second string to an empty first string\'\'\n   \n    \'\'\'for\'\'\' j \'\'\'in\'\'\' [1..n]\n      \'\'\'for\'\'\' i \'\'\'in\'\'\' [1..m]\n        \'\'\'if\'\'\' s[i] = t[j] \'\'\'then\'\'\'  <!-- not: s[i-1] = t[j-1] -->\n          d[i, j] \xe2\x86\x90 d[i-1, j-1]       \'\'// no operation required\'\'\n        \'\'\'else\'\'\'\n          d[i, j] \xe2\x86\x90 minimum of\n                     (\n                       d[i-1, j] + 1,  \'\'// a deletion\'\'\n                       d[i, j-1] + 1,  \'\'// an insertion\'\'\n                       d[i-1, j-1] + 1 \'\'// a substitution\'\'\n                     )\n   \n    \'\'\'return\'\'\' d[m,n]\n\nTwo examples of the resulting matrix (hovering over an underlined number reveals the operation performed to get that number):\n<center>\n{|\n|\n{|class="wikitable"\n|-\n| \n| \n!k \n!i \n!t \n!t \n!e \n!n\n|-\n| ||0 ||1 ||2 ||3 ||4 ||5 ||6\n|-\n!s\n|1 ||{{H:title|substitution of \'k\' for \'s\'|1}} ||2 ||3 ||4 ||5 ||6\n|-\n!i\n|2 ||2 ||{{H:title|\'i\' equals \'i\'|1}} ||2 ||3 ||4 ||5\n|-\n!t\n|3 ||3 ||2 ||{{H:title|\'t\' equals \'t\'|1}} ||2 ||3 ||4\n|-\n!t\n|4 ||4 ||3 ||2 ||{{H:title|\'t\' equals \'t\'|1}} ||2 ||3 \n|-\n!i\n|5 ||5 ||4 ||3 ||2 ||{{H:title|substitution of \'e\' for \'i\'|2}} ||3\n|-\n!n\n|6 ||6 ||5 ||4 ||3 ||3 ||{{H:title|\'n\' equals \'n\'|2}}\n|-\n!g\n|7 ||7 ||6 ||5 ||4 ||4 ||{{H:title|insert \'g\'|3}}\n|}\n|\n{|class="wikitable"\n|\n|\n!S\n!a\n!t\n!u\n!r\n!d\n!a\n!y\n|-\n| \n|0 ||1 ||2 ||3 ||4 ||5 ||6 ||7 ||8\n|-\n!S\n|1 ||{{H:title|\'S\' equals \'S\'|0}} ||{{H:title|insert \'a\'|1}} ||{{H:title|insert \'t\'|2}} ||3 ||4 ||5 ||6 ||7\n|-\n!u\n|2 ||1 ||1 ||2 ||{{H:title|\'u\' equals \'u\'|2}} ||3 ||4 ||5 ||6\n|-\n!n\n|3 ||2 ||2 ||2 ||3 ||{{H:title|substitution of \'r\' for \'n\'|3}} ||4 ||5 ||6\n|-\n!d\n|4 ||3 ||3 ||3 ||3 ||4 ||{{H:title|\'d\' equals \'d\'|3}} ||4 ||5 \n|-\n!a\n|5 ||4 ||3 ||4 ||4 ||4 ||4 ||{{H:title|\'a\' equals \'a\'|3}} ||4\n|-\n!y\n|6 ||5 ||4 ||4 ||5 ||5 ||5 ||4 ||{{H:title|\'y\' equals \'y\'|3}}\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] maintained throughout the algorithm is that we can transform the initial segment <code>s[1..i]</code> into <code>t[1..j]</code> using a minimum of <code>d[i,j]</code> operations. At the end, the bottom-right element of the array contains the answer.\n\n===Proof of correctness===\nAs mentioned earlier, the [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] is that we can transform the initial segment <code>s[1..i]</code> into <code>t[1..j]</code> using a minimum of <code>d[i,j]</code> operations. This invariant holds since:\n* It is initially true on row and column 0 because <code>s[1..i]</code> can be transformed into the empty string <code>t[1..0]</code> by simply dropping all <code>i</code> characters. Similarly, we can transform <code>s[1..0]</code> to <code>t[1..j]</code> by simply adding all <code>j</code> characters.\n* If <code>s[i] = t[j]</code>, and we can transform <code>s[1..i-1]</code> to <code>t[1..j-1]</code> in <code>k</code> operations, then we can do the same to <code>s[1..i]</code> and just leave the last character alone, giving <code>k</code> operations.\n* Otherwise, the distance is the minimum of the three possible ways to do the transformation:\n** If we can transform <code>s[1..i]</code> to <code>t[1..j-1]</code> in <code>k</code> operations, then we can simply add <code>t[j]</code> afterwards to get <code>t[1..j]</code> in <code>k+1</code> operations (insertion).\n** If we can transform <code>s[1..i-1]</code> to <code>t[1..j]</code> in <code>k</code> operations, then we can remove <code>s[i]</code> and then do the same transformation, for a total of <code>k+1</code> operations (deletion).\n** If we can transform <code>s[1..i-1]</code> to <code>t[1..j-1]</code> in <code>k</code> operations, then we can do the same to <code>s[1..i]</code>, and exchange the original <code>s[i]</code> for <code>t[j]</code> afterwards, for a total of <code>k+1</code> operations (substitution).\n* The operations required to transform <code>s[1..n]</code> into <code>t[1..m]</code> is of course the number required to transform all of <code>s</code> into all of <code>t</code>, and so <code>d[n,m]</code> holds our result.\n\nThis proof fails to validate that the number placed in <code>d[i,j]</code> is in fact minimal; this is more difficult to show, and involves an [[Reductio ad absurdum|argument by contradiction]] in which we assume <code>d[i,j]</code> is smaller than the minimum of the three, and use this to show one of the three is not minimal.\n\n===Possible improvements===\nPossible improvements to this algorithm include:\n* We can adapt the algorithm to use less space, [[Big O notation|\'\'O\'\']](\'\'m\'\') instead of \'\'O\'\'(\'\'mn\'\'), since it only requires that the previous row and current row be stored at any one time.\n* We can store the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions separately, or even the positions at which they occur, which is always <code>j</code>.\n* We can normalize the distance to the interval <code>[0,1]</code>.\n* If we are only interested in the distance if it is smaller than a threshold \'\'k\'\', then it suffices to compute a diagonal stripe of width \'\'2k+1\'\' in the matrix. In this way, the algorithm can be run in [[Big O notation|\'\'O\'\']](\'\'kl\'\') time, where \'\'l\'\' is the length of the shortest string.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gusfield, Dan |title=Algorithms on strings, trees, and sequences: computer science and computational biology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-58519-8 }}</ref>\n* We can give different penalty costs to insertion, deletion and substitution. We can also give penalty costs that depend on which characters are inserted, deleted or substituted.\n* This algorithm [[parallel computing|parallelizes]] poorly, due to a large number of [[data dependency|data dependencies]]. However, all the <code>cost</code> values can be computed in parallel, and the algorithm can be adapted to perform the <code>minimum</code> function in phases to eliminate dependencies.\n* By examining diagonals instead of rows, and by using [[lazy evaluation]], we can find the Levenshtein distance in \'\'O\'\'(\'\'m\'\' (1 + \'\'d\'\')) time (where \'\'d\'\' is the Levenshtein distance), which is much faster than the regular dynamic programming algorithm if the distance is small.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allison L |title=Lazy Dynamic-Programming can be Eager |journal=Inf.

S"{{COI|date=April 2010}}\nThe online portal '''Greenpilot''' is a service provided by the German National Library of Medicine, ZB MED.\n\nThe project is funded by the German Research Foundation ([[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]) and gets its technical support from  [[Averbis]] Ltd. The portal first went online May 29, 2009 and currently runs in the updated beta version. In the context of the 'Germany - Land of Ideas' (Deutschland - Land der Ideen) initiative under the patronage of the [[President of Germany]] [[Horst K\xc3\xb6hler]] the ZB MED was awarded the distinction 'Selected Landmark 2009' (Ausgew\xc3\xa4hlter Ort 2009).<ref>[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news315583 Pressemitteilung im Informationsdienst Wissenschaft vom 15. Mai 2009 ]</ref>\n\n==Objective==\nThe Greenpilot portal is a [[digital library]] specialised in the fields of Nutritional, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. It aims to provide researchers in the three fields with a collection of scientific literature which is easy to access and of high quality. Especially the [[gray literature]] is often difficult to find and retrieve for the average user so Greenpilot also aims to make access to these sources easier. The service addresses itself not only to scientists and students but also to the broadly interested public. Greenpilot has been modelled after the corresponding digital library for Medicine, Medpilot,<ref>[http://www.medpilot.de/ Medpilot portal]</ref> also a project of the German National Library of Medicine. The ZB MED has chosen the slogan 'Greenpilot - all about life and science' as a motto. In Greenpilot scientifically relevant databases, library catalogues and websites can be searched by entering a search term and the results are presented in a standardised web interface.\n\n==Technical Background==\nGreenpilot is a search engine based on intuitive search engine technology. The portal's software was developed in the programming language [[Perl]]. The search engine technology is based upon the 'Averbis Search Platform' software developed by the Averbis Ltd. and uses the [[open source]] software [[Lucene]]. Functionally this is an expert search engine which centres around the intelligent semantic connection of search terms by means of a standardised vocabulary. This is made possible by Averbis's MSI software which provides:\n\n* semantic search optimised for the fields of Medicine and Life Sciences\n* a contextual analysis of texts taking synonyms and compounds into account\n* multilingual and cross-language search\n* linking of lay and expert vocabulary\nThe search results are generated from a search index.\n\nAdditionally a [[metasearch]] can be conducted in order to search other databases not contained in the index. This search is based upon individual results from the specific database searched.\n\n==Contents==\nThe Greenpilot portal integrates various scientifically relevant information resources under a uniform search interface. These resources are diverse and encompass national and international expert databases, library catalogues of national libraries with a focus on specific topics, full text documents from [[open access (publishing)|open access]] journals as well as information contained on about one thousand scientifically relevant websites selected for Greenpilot.\nThe following is a list of sources from November 2009:<ref>[http://www.greenpilot.de/beta2/app/misc/help/8cafcf93601eb861aaef86b5ce99ecdc/Datenbanken List of databases in Greenpilot]</ref>\n\n===Library Catalogues===\n* Catalogue of the German National Library of Medicine (ZB MED Nutrition.

Firth]].<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1957}}</ref> This assumption is known in [[Linguistics]] as the [[Distributional hypothesis|Distributional Hypothesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2008}}</ref> Emile Delavenay defined \'\'Statistical Semantics\'\' as "Statistical study of meanings of words and their frequency and order of recurrence."<ref>{{harvnb|Delavenay|1960}}</ref> "[[George Furnas|Furnas]] \'\'et al.\'\' 1983" is frequently cited as a foundational contribution to Statistical Semantics.<ref>{{harvnb|Furnas|Landauer|Gomez|Dumais|1983}}</ref>  An early success in the field was [[Latent semantic analysis|Latent Semantic Analysis]].\n\n==Applications of statistical semantics==\n\nResearch in Statistical Semantics has resulted in a wide variety of algorithms that use the Distributional Hypothesis to discover many aspects of [[semantics]], by applying statistical techniques to [[Text corpus|large corpora]]:\n* Measuring the [[Semantic similarity|similarity in word meanings]] <ref>{{harvnb|Lund|Burgess|Atchley|1995}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Landauer|Dumais|1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Ramscar|2001}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Terra|Clarke|2003}}</ref>\n* Measuring the similarity in word relations <ref>{{harvnb|Turney|2006}}</ref>\n* Modeling [[similarity-based generalization]] <ref>{{harvnb|Yarlett|2008}}</ref>\n* Discovering words with a given relation <ref>{{harvnb|Hearst|1992}}</ref>\n* Classifying relations between words <ref>{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|2005}}</ref>\n* Extracting keywords from documents <ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Paynter|Witten|Gutwin|1999}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Turney|2000}}</ref>\n* Measuring the cohesiveness of text <ref>{{harvnb|Turney|2003}}</ref>\n* Discovering the different senses of words <ref>{{harvnb|Pantel|Lin|2002}}</ref>\n* Distinguishing the different senses of words <ref>{{harvnb|Turney|2004}}</ref>\n* Subcognitive aspects of words <ref>{{harvnb|Turney|2001}}</ref>\n* Distinguishing praise from criticism <ref>{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|2003}}</ref>\n\n==Related fields==\n\nStatistical Semantics focuses on the meanings of common words and the relations between common words, unlike [[text mining]], which tends to focus on whole documents, document collections, or named entities (names of people, places, and organizations). Statistical Semantics is a subfield of [[computational semantics]], which is in turn a subfield of [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]].\n\nMany of the applications of Statistical Semantics (listed above) can also be addressed by [[lexicon]]-based algorithms, instead of the [[text corpus|corpus]]-based algorithms of Statistical Semantics. One advantage of corpus-based algorithms is that they are typically not as labour-intensive as lexicon-based algorithms. Another advantage is that they are usually easier to adapt to new languages than lexicon-based algorithms. However, the best performance on an application is often achieved by combining the two approaches.<ref>{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|Bigham|Shnayder|2003}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Linguistics}}\n*[[Latent semantic analysis]]\n*[[Latent semantic indexing]]\n*[[Text mining]]\n*[[Information retrieval]]\n*[[Natural language processing]]\n*[[Computational linguistics]]\n*[[Web mining]]\n*[[Semantic similarity]]\n*[[Co-occurrence]]\n*[[Text corpus]]\n*[[Semantic Analytics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Delavenay | first = Emile | year = 1960 | title = An Introduction to Machine Translation | location = New York, NY | publisher = [[Thames and Hudson]] | oclc = 1001646 | ref = harv }}\n\n* {{cite journal | last = Firth | first = John R. | authorlink = John Rupert Firth | year = 1957 | title = A synopsis of linguistic theory 1930-1955 | journal = [[Studies in Linguistic Analysis]] | pages = 1\xe2\x80\x9332 | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Philological Society]] | ref = harv }}\n*: Reprinted in {{cite book | editor1-first = F.R. | editor1-last = Palmer | title = Selected Papers of J.R.

S'{{For|the Canadian magazine|Exclaim!}}\nThe \'\'\'EXtensible Cross-Linguistic Automatic Information Machine (EXCLAIM)\'\'\' is an integrated tool for [[cross-language information retrieval]] (CLIR), created at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in early 2006. It is currently in a beta stage of development, with some support for more than a dozen languages. The lead developers are Justin Nuger and Jesse Saba Kirchner.\n\nEarly work on CLIR depended on manually constructed parallel corpora for each pair of languages. This method is labor-intensive compared to parallel corpora created automatically. A more efficient way of finding data to train a CLIR system is to use matching pages on the [[World Wide Web|web]] which are written in different languages.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=Cross-Language Information Retrieval based on Parallel Texts and Automatic Mining of Parallel Texts in the Web\n|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Enie/Publication/nie-sigir99.pdf\n|format=PDF|publisher=ACM-SIGIR 1999\n|accessdate=2006-12-02\n}}\n</ref>\n\nEXCLAIM capitalizes on the idea of latent parallel corpora on the [[World Wide Web|web]] by automating the alignment of such corpora in various domains. The most significant of these is [[Wikipedia]] itself, which includes articles in [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_language_Wikipedias_available 250 languages]. The role of EXCLAIM is to use [[semantics]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] analytic tools to align the information in these Wikipedias so that they can be treated as parallel corpora. EXCLAIM is also extensible to incorporate information from many other sources, such as the [[Chinese Community Health Resource Center]] (CCHRC).\n\nOne of the main goals of the EXCLAIM project is to provide the kind of computational tools and CLIR tools for [[minority languages]] and [[endangered languages]] which are often available only for powerful or prosperous majority languages.\n\n==Current status==\n\nEXCLAIM is in a beta state, with varying degrees of functionality for different languages. Support for CLIR using the Wikipedia dataset and the most current version of EXCLAIM (v.0.5), including full UTF-8 support and Porter stemming for the English component, is available for the following twenty-three languages:\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n| [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n|-\n| [[Amharic]]\n|-\n| [[Bengali language|Bengali]]\n|-\n| [[Gothic language|Gothic]]\n|-\n| [[Greek language|Greek]]\n|-\n| [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n|-\n| [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]\n|-\n| [[Irish language|Irish]]\n|-\n| [[Javanese language|Javanese]]\n|-\n| [[Latvian language|Latvian]]\n|-\n| [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]\n|-\n| [[Mandarin Chinese]]\n|-\n| [[Nahuatl]]\n|-\n| [[Navajo language|Navajo]]\n|-\n| [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]\n|-\n| [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]\n|-\n| [[Swahili language|Swahili]]\n|-\n| [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]\n|-\n| [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]\n|-\n| [[Turkish language|Turkish]]\n|-\n| [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\n|-\n| [[Wolof language|Wolof]]\n|-\n| [[Yiddish]]\n|}\n\nSupport using the Wikipedia dataset and an earlier version of EXCLAIM (v.0.3) is available for the following languages:\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n|-\n| [[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n|-\n| [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n|}\n\nSignificant developments in the most recent version of EXCLAIM include support for Mandarin Chinese. By developing support for this language, EXCLAIM has added solutions to [[text segmentation|segmentation]] and [[character encoding|encoding]] problems which will allow the system to be extended to many other languages written with non-European orthographic conventions. This support is supplied through the Trimming And Reformatting Modular System ([[TARMS]]) toolkit.\n\nFuture versions of EXCLAIM will extend the system to additional languages. Other goals include incorporation of available latent datasets in addition to the Wikipedia dataset.\n\nThe EXCLAIM development plan calls for an integrated CLIR instrument usable searching from English for information in any of the supported languages, or searching from any of the supported languages for information in English when EXCLAIM 1.0 is released. Future versions will allow searching from any supported language into any other, and searching from and into multiple languages.\n\n==Further applications==\n\nEXCLAIM has been incorporated into several projects which rely on cross-language [[query expansion]] as part of their [[backend]]s. One such project is a cross-linguistic [[readability]] software generation framework, detailed in work presented at [[Association for Computational Linguistics|ACL 2009]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=A crosslinguistic readability framework\n|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W09/W09-3103.pdf\n|format=PDF|publisher=ACL-IJNLP 2009\n|accessdate=2009-09-04\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~jnuger/cgi-bin/exclaim.cgi EXCLAIM Website]\n*[http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html Semantic Web Roadmap]\n*[http://www.cchphmo.com/cchrchealth/index_E.html Chinese Cultural Health Resource Center]\n*[http://ju-st.in/ Justin Nuger\'s professional webpage]\n*[http://people.ucsc.edu/~kirchner/ Jesse Saba Kirchner\'s professional webpage]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Exclaim}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

S'{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n\'\'\'Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR)\'\'\' is a subfield of [[information retrieval]] dealing with retrieving information written in a language different from the language of the user\'s query. For example, a user may pose their query in English but retrieve relevant documents written in French. To do so, most of CLIR systems use translation techniques.  CLIR techniques can be classified into different categories based on different translation resources: \n* Dictionary-based CLIR techniques\n* Parallel corpora based CLIR techniques\n* Comparable corpora based CLIR techniques\n* Machine translator based CLIR techniques\n\nThe first workshop on CLIR was held in Z\xc3\xbcrich during the SIGIR-96 conference.<ref>The proceedings of this workshop can be found in the book \'\'Cross-Language Information Retrieval\'\' (Grefenstette, ed; Kluwer, 1998) ISBN 0-7923-8122-X.</ref> Workshops have been held yearly since 2000 at the meetings of the [[Cross Language Evaluation Forum]] (CLEF).\n\nThe term "cross-language information retrieval" has many synonyms, of which the following are perhaps the most frequent: cross-lingual information retrieval, translingual information retrieval, multilingual information retrieval. The term "multilingual information retrieval" refers to CLIR in general, but it also has a specific meaning of cross-language information retrieval where a document collection is multilingual.\n\n==See also==\n*[[EXCLAIM]] (EXtensible Cross-Linguistic Automatic Information Machine)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.glue.umd.edu/~oard/research.html A resource page for CLIR]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cross-Language Information Retrieval}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Natural language processing]]\n\n\n{{linguistics-stub}}'

S'In [[natural language processing]] and [[information retrieval]], \'\'\'cluster labeling\'\'\' is the problem of picking descriptive, human-readable labels for the clusters produced by a [[document clustering]] algorithm; standard clustering algorithms do not typically produce any such labels. Cluster labeling algorithms examine the contents of the documents per cluster to find labeling that summarize the topic of each cluster and distinguish the clusters from each other.\n\n==Differential cluster labeling==\nDifferential cluster labeling labels a cluster by comparing term [[probability distribution|distributions]] across clusters, using techniques also used for [[feature selection]] in [[document classification]], such as [[mutual information]] and [[Pearson\'s chi-squared test|chi-squared feature selection]].  Terms having very low frequency are not the best in representing the whole cluster and can be omitted in labeling a cluster.  By omitting those rare terms and using a differential test, one can achieve the best results with differential cluster labeling.<ref>Manning, Christopher D., Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Schutze. \'\'Introduction to Information Retrieval\'\'. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. \'\'Cluster Labeling\'\'. Stanford Natural Language Processing Group. Web. 25 Nov. 2009. <http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/cluster-labeling-1.html>.</ref>\n\n===Pointwise mutual information===\n\n{{Main|Pointwise mutual information}}\n\nIn the fields of [[probability theory]] and [[information theory]], mutual information measures the degree of dependence of two [[random variables]].  The mutual information of two variables {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} is defined as:\n\n<math>I(X, Y) = \\sum_{x\\in X}{ \\sum_{y\\in Y} {p(x, y)log_2\\left(\\frac{p(x, y)}{p_1(x)p_2(y)}\\right)}}</math>\n\nwhere \'\'p(x, y)\'\' is the [[joint probability|joint probability distribution]] of the two variables, \'\'p<sub>1</sub>(x)\'\' is the probability distribution of X, and \'\'p<sub>2</sub>(y)\'\' is the probability distribution of Y.\n\nIn the case of cluster labeling, the variable X is associated with membership in a cluster, and the variable Y is associated with the presence of a term.<ref>Manning, Christopher D., Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Schutze. \'\'Introduction to Information Retrieval\'\'. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. \'\'Mutual Information\'\'. Stanford Natural Language Processing Group. Web. 25 Nov. 2009. <http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/mutual-information-1.html>.</ref>  Both variables can have values of 0 or 1, so the equation can be rewritten as follows:\n\n<math>I(C, T) = \\sum_{c\\in {0, 1}}{ \\sum_{t\\in {0, 1}} {p(C = c, T = t)log_2\\left(\\frac{p(C = c, T = t)}{p(C = c)p(T = t)}\\right)}}</math>\n\nIn this case, \'\'p(C = 1)\'\' represents the probability that a randomly selected document is a member of a particular cluster, and \'\'p(C = 0)\'\' represents the probability that it isn\'t.  Similarly, \'\'p(T = 1)\'\' represents the probability that a randomly selected document contains a given term, and \'\'p(T = 0)\'\' represents the probability that it doesn\'t.  The [[joint probability|joint probability distribution function]] \'\'p(C, T)\'\' represents the probability that two events occur simultaneously.  For example, \'\'p(0, 0)\'\' is the probability that a document isn\'t a member of cluster \'\'c\'\' and doesn\'t contain term \'\'t\'\'; \'\'p(0, 1)\'\' is the probability that a document isn\'t a member of cluster \'\'c\'\' and does contain term \'\'t\'\'; and so on.\n\n===Chi-Squared Selection===\n{{Main|Pearson\'s chi-squared test}}\nThe Pearson\'s chi-squared test can be used to calculate the probability that the occurrence of an event matches the initial expectations.  In particular, it can be used to determine whether two events, A and B, are [[statistically independent]].  The value of the chi-squared statistic is:\n\n<math>X^2 = \\sum_{a \\in A}{\\sum_{b \\in B}{\\frac{(O_{a,b} - E_{a, b})^2}{E_{a, b}}}}</math>\n\nwhere \'\'O<sub>a,b</sub>\'\' is the \'\'observed\'\' frequency of a and b co-occurring, and \'\'E<sub>a,b</sub>\'\' is the \'\'expected\'\' frequency of co-occurrence.\n\nIn the case of cluster labeling, the variable A is associated with membership in a cluster, and the variable B is associated with the presence of a term.  Both variables can have values of 0 or 1, so the equation can be rewritten as follows:\n\n<math>X^2 = \\sum_{a \\in {0,1}}{\\sum_{b \\in {0,1}}{\\frac{(O_{a,b} - E_{a, b})^2}{E_{a, b}}}}</math>\n\nFor example, \'\'O<sub>1,0</sub>\'\' is the observed number of documents that are in a particular cluster but don\'t contain a certain term, and \'\'E<sub>1,0</sub>\'\' is the expected number of documents that are in a particular cluster but don\'t contain a certain term.\nOur initial assumption is that the two events are independent, so the expected probabilities of co-occurrence can be calculated by multiplying individual probabilities:<ref>Manning, Christopher D., Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Schutze. \'\'Introduction to Information Retrieval\'\'. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. \'\'Chi2 Feature Selection\'\'. Stanford Natural Language Processing Group. Web. 25 Nov. 2009. <http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/feature-selectionchi2-feature-selection-1.html>.</ref>\n\n\'\'E<sub>1,0</sub> = N * P(C = 1) * P(T = 0)\'\'\n\nwhere N is the total number of documents in the collection.\n\n==Cluster-Internal Labeling==\nCluster-internal labeling selects labels that only depend on the contents of the cluster of interest. No comparison is made with the other clusters.\nCluster-internal labeling can use a variety of methods, such as finding terms that occur frequently in the centroid or finding the document that lies closest to the centroid.\n\n===Centroid Labels===\n{{Main|Vector space model}}\nA frequently used model in the field of [[information retrieval]] is the vector space model, which represents documents as vectors.  The entries in the vector correspond to terms in the [[vocabulary]]. Binary vectors have a value of 1 if the term is present within a particular document and 0 if it is absent. Many vectors make use of weights that reflect the importance of a term in a document, and/or the importance of the term in a document collection. For a particular cluster of documents, we can calculate the [[centroid]] by finding the [[arithmetic mean]] of all the document vectors.  If an entry in the centroid vector has a high value, then the corresponding term occurs frequently within the cluster.  These terms can be used as a label for the cluster.\nOne downside to using centroid labeling is that it can pick up words like "place" and "word" that have a high frequency in written text, but have little relevance to the contents of the particular cluster.\n\n===Contextualized centroid labels===\nA simple, cost-effective way of overcoming the above limitation is to embed the centroid terms with the highest weight in a graph structure that provides a context for their interpretation and selection. <ref>Francois Role, Moahmed Nadif. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2574675 Beyond cluster labeling: Semantic interpretation of clusters\xe2\x80\x99 contents using a graph representation.] Knowledge-Based Systems, Volume 56, January, 2014: 141-155</ref>\nIn this approach, a term-term co-occurrence matrix referred as <math>T_k</math> is first built for each cluster <math>S_k</math>. Each cell represents the number of times term <math>i</math> co-occurs with term <math>j</math> within a certain window of text (a sentence, a paragraph, etc.)\nIn a second stage, a similarity matrix <math>T_k^{sim}</math> is obtained by multiplying <math>T_k</math> with its transpose. We have <math>T_k^{sim}=T_k\' T_k=(t_{{sim}_{ij}})</math>. Being the dot product of two normalized vectors <math>\\tilde{t}_{i}</math> and <math>\\tilde{t}_{j}</math>, <math>t_{{sim}_{ij}}</math> denotes the cosine similarity between terms <math>i</math> and <math>j</math>. The so obtained <math>T_k^{sim}</math> can then be used as the weighted adjacency matrix of a term similarity graph. The centroid terms are part of this graph, and they thus can be interpreted and scored by inspecting the terms that surround them in the graph.\n\n===Title labels===\nAn alternative to centroid labeling is title labeling.  Here, we find the document within the cluster that has the smallest [[Euclidean distance]] to the centroid, and use its title as a label for the cluster.  One advantage to using document titles is that they provide additional information that would not be present in a list of terms.  However, they also have the potential to mislead the user, since one document might not be representative of the entire cluster.\n\n===External knowledge labels===\nCluster labeling can be done indirectly using external knowledge such as pre-categorized knowledge such as the one of Wikipedia.<ref>David Carmel, Haggai Roitman, Naama Zwerdling. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1571941.1571967 Enhancing cluster labeling using wikipedia.] SIGIR 2009: 139-146</ref> In such methods, a set of important cluster text features are first extracted from the cluster documents. These features then can be used to retrieve the (weighted) K-nearest categorized documents from which candidates for cluster labels can be extracted. The final step involves the ranking of such candidates. Suitable methods are such that are based on a voting or a fusion process which is determined using the set of categorized documents and the original cluster features.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/hierarchical-clustering-1.html Hierarchical Clustering]\n* [http://erulemaking.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/papers/dgo06-labeling.pdf Automatically Labeling Hierarchical Clusters]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cluster Labeling}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

S'{{primary sources|date=March 2012}}\n\'\'\'Russian Science Citation Index\'\'\' is a [[bibliographic database]] of [[scientific publication]]s in Russian. It accumulates more than 2 million publications of Russian authors, as well as information about citing these publications from more than 2000 Russian journals. The Russian Science Citation Index has been developed since 2009 by the Scientific Electronic Library. The information-analytical system Science Index is a search engine of this database; it offers a wide range of services for authors, research institutions and scientific publishers. It is designed not only for operational search for relevant bibliographic information, but is also as a powerful tool to assess the impact and effectiveness of research organizations, scientists, and the level of scientific journals, etc.\n\n== Purpose ==\nFrom 3000 Russian scientific journals only about 150 are presented in foreign databases (i.e. not more than 5%). Those are mainly translated journals. So far, the vast majority of Russian scientific publications remain "invisible" and not available online.  Russian Science Citation Index makes it real to objectively compare Russian journals with  the best international journals and brings them closer to researchers all over the world.\n\n== Functionality ==\nIn Russia, this database is one of the main sources of information for evaluating the effectiveness of organizations involved in research. It allows to appraise: \n* Scientific capacity and effectiveness of research, and\n* Publication activity\nthrough the following indicators:\n* The number of publications (including foreign scientific and technical journals, and local publications from the list of [[Higher Attestation Commission]]) of researchers from a particular scientific organization, divided by the number of researchers,\n* The number of publications (registered in the Russian Science Citation Index) of researchers from a particular scientific organization, divided by the number of researchers, and\n* Citation of researchers (registered in the Russian Science Citation Index) from a particular scientific organization, divided by the number of researchers.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of academic databases and search engines]]\n*[[Science Citation Index]]\n*[[Scopus]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://elibrary.ru/ Scientific Electronic Library]\n\n\n[[Category:Citation indices]]'

S'\'\'\'Adversarial information retrieval\'\'\' (\'\'\'adversarial IR\'\'\') is a topic in [[information retrieval]] related to strategies for working with a data source where some portion of it has been manipulated maliciously.  Tasks can include gathering, indexing, filtering, retrieving and ranking information from such a data source. Adversarial IR includes the study of methods to detect, isolate, and defeat such manipulation.\n\nOn the Web, the predominant form of such manipulation is [[spamdexing|search engine spamming]] (also known as spamdexing), which involves employing various techniques to disrupt the activity of [[web search engines]], usually for financial gain. Examples of spamdexing are [[Google bomb|link-bombing]], [[comment spam (disambiguation)|comment]] or [[referrer spam]], [[spam blog]]s (splogs), malicious tagging.  [[Reverse engineering]] of [[ranking function|ranking algorithms]], [[Ad filtering|advertisement blocking]], and [[web content filtering]] may also be considered forms of adversarial [[data manipulation]].<ref>B.

S"The '''Extended Boolean model''' was described in a Communications of the ACM article appearing in 1983, by Gerard Salton, Edward A. Fox, and Harry Wu. The goal of the Extended Boolean model is to overcome the drawbacks of the Boolean model that has been used in [[information retrieval]]. The Boolean model doesn't consider term weights in queries, and the result set of a Boolean query is often either too small or too big. The idea of the extended model is to make use of partial matching and term weights as in the vector space model. It combines the characteristics of the [[Vector Space Model]] with the properties of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and ranks the similarity between queries and documents. This way a document may be somewhat relevant if it matches some of the queried terms and will be returned as a result, whereas in the [[Standard Boolean model]] it wasn't.<ref>\t\n{{citation | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358466 | last=Salton | first=Gerard | coauthors=Edward A. Fox, Harry Wu | title=Extended Boolean information retrieval | publisher=Communications of the ACM, Volume 26,  Issue 11 | year=1983 }}</ref>\n\nThus, the extended Boolean model can be considered as a generalization of both the Boolean and vector space models; those two are special cases if suitable settings and definitions are employed. Further, research has shown effectiveness improves relative to that for Boolean query processing.  Other research has shown that [[relevance feedback]] and [[query expansion]] can be integrated with extended Boolean query processing.\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the '''Extended Boolean model''', a document is represented as a vector (similarly to in the vector model). Each ''i'' [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] corresponds to a separate term associated with the document.\n\nThe weight of term {{math|''K<sub>x</sub>''}} associated with document {{math|''d<sub>j</sub>''}} is measured by its normalized [[Term frequency]] and can be defined as:\n\n<math>\nw_{x,j}=f_{x,j}*\\frac{Idf_{x}}{max_{i}Idf_{i}}\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''Idf<sub>x</sub>''}} is [[inverse document frequency]].\n\nThe weight vector associated with document {{math|''d<sub>j</sub>''}} can be represented as:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{v}_{d_j} = [w_{1,j}, w_{2,j}, \\ldots, w_{i,j}]</math>\n\n==The 2 Dimensions Example==\n{{multiple image\n | width     = 150\n | image1    = 2D_Extended_Boolean_model_OR_example.png\n | alt1      = Figure 1\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1:''' The similarities of {{math|''q'' {{=}} (''K<sub>x</sub>'' &or; ''K<sub>y</sub>'')}} with documents {{math|''d<sub>j</sub>''}} and {{math|''d''<sub>''j''+1</sub>}}.\n | image2    = 2D_Extended_Boolean_model_AND_example.png\n | alt2      = Figure 2\n | caption2  = '''Figure 2:''' The similarities of {{math|''q'' {{=}} (''K<sub>x</sub>'' &and; ''K<sub>y</sub>'')}} with documents {{math|''d<sub>j</sub>''}} and {{math|''d''<sub>''j''+1</sub>}}.\n}}\n\nConsidering the space composed of two terms {{math|''K<sub>x</sub>''}} and {{math|''K<sub>y</sub>''}} only, the corresponding term weights are {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub>}}.<ref>[http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~cs5286/Lectures/Lwang.ppt Lusheng Wang]</ref>  Thus, for query {{math|''q<sub>or</sub>'' {{=}} (''K<sub>x</sub>'' &or; ''K<sub>y</sub>'')}}, we can calculate the similarity with the following formula:\n \n<math>sim(q_{or},d)=\\sqrt{\\frac{w_1^2+w_2^2}{2}}</math>\n\nFor query {{math|''q<sub>and</sub>'' {{=}} (''K<sub>x</sub>'' &and; ''K<sub>y</sub>'')}}, we can use:\n\n<math>sim(q_{and},d)=1-\\sqrt{\\frac{(1-w_1)^2+(1-w_2)^2}{2}}</math>\n\n==Generalizing the idea and P-norms==\nWe can generalize the previous 2D extended Boolean model example to higher t-dimensional space using Euclidean distances.\n\nThis can be done using [[P-norm]]s which extends the notion of distance to include p-distances, where {{math|1 &le; ''p'' &le; &infin;}} is a new parameter.<ref>{{ citation | last=Garcia | first= Dr. E. | url=http://www.miislita.com/term-vector/term-vector-6-boolean-model.html | title=The Extended Boolean Model - Weighted Queries: Term Weights, p-Norm Queries and Multiconcept Types.

S"'''Tunebot''' is a music search engine developed by the Interactive Audio Lab at [[Northwestern University]]. Users can search the database by humming or singing a melody into a microphone, playing the melody on a virtual keyboard, or by typing some of the lyrics. This allows users to finally identify that song that was stuck in their head.\n\n==Searching Techniques==\n\nTunebot is a [[Query by humming]] system. It compares a sung query to a database of musical themes by using the intervals between each note. This allows a user to sing in a different key than the target recording and still produce a match. The intervals are also unquantized to allow for other tunings besides the standard A=440Hz, since not many people in the world have [[perfect pitch]].\n\nIn addition to note intervals, Tunebot compares a query with potential targets by using rhythmic ratios between notes. Since ratios between note lengths are used, the tempo of the performance does not affect the rhythmic similarity measure. \n\nQueries and targets are then matched by a weighted string alignment algorithm between the note intervals and rhythmic ratios.\n<!--Note segmentation, then to pitches and then use Pitch intervals (instead of melodic contour - measured frequency at given times). Pitch intervals are relative (unquantized) to adjust for singing in the wrong key or wrong tempo. Faster and more reliable search.\n\nModel singer error: gaussian distribution because wider interval and lower intervals seem to be more prone to singer error. Combination of gaussians with 5 parameters to tweak: pitch weight, rhythm weight, sensitivity to distance for pitch, sensisitivity to distance for rhythm, octave decay\n\nDo we use rhythmic ratios? (LIR)\n\nGenetic algorithm to tune system parameters-->\n\n==The Database==\nThe database consists of unaccompanied melodies sung by contributors (a capella). Contributors log into the website and sing their examples to the system. Each of these recordings is associated with a corresponding song on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. A sung query is compared to these examples. A capella sung examples are used as search keys because it is much easier to compare one unaccompanied vocal (the sung query) to another (an example search key) than it is to compare an unaccompanied vocal to a full band recording, which may contain guitar, drums, other singers, sound effects, etc.\n\n==Distinguishing Features==\n\nTunebot learns from user input, and it improve its results as each user submits more queries. Since no human can sing perfectly in tune every time they sing, the search engine must take that into account. By choosing a song from a list of ranked results, users tell Tunebot which song was correct. Tunebot then pairs that song with the user's query, analyzes the differences, and runs a [[Genetic Algorithm]]. This process tweaks the parameters that control how the system compares the user's query to the targets. For instance, if a user has no sense of rhythm, that factor of the comparison is lowered for future queries.\n\n==References==\n\n* B. Pardo.

It creates an [[acoustic fingerprint]] based on the sample, and compares it against a central database for a match.  If it finds a match, it sends information such as the artist, song title, and album back to the user. Some implementations of Shazam incorporate relevant links to services such as [[iTunes]], [[YouTube]], [[Spotify]] or [[Zune]]. In December of 2013, Shazam was one of the top ten apps in the world, according to its CEO.<ref>http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000222563#.</ref> The Shazam app has more than 100 million monthly active users and has been used on more than 500 million mobile devices.<ref>http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/08/20/shazam-now-100-million-monthly-active-users-mobile/</ref> In October of 2014, Shazam announced its technology has been used to identify 15 billion songs.<ref>http://www.siliconrepublic.com/digital-life/item/38714-15-billion-songs-have-been</ref>\n==Features==\nShazam offers two types of applications; a free app simply called Shazam and a paid app called Shazam Encore. The service was expanded in September 2012 to enable TV users in the US to identify featured music, access cast information and get links to show information online, as well as adding social networking capabilities.<ref name="TV tags"/>\n\nIn February of 2014, Shazam announced a redesign of the app, which included a new look and additional features, including lyric-viewing options, access to music videos and related videos, unique recommendations, improved biographies and discographies and additional functionality for use with TV shows. The update also featured a News Feed, and Auto-Shazam, a feature introduced in December of 2013, which runs in the background of users\xe2\x80\x99 mobile devices to automatically identify media.<ref>http://www.digitaltveurope.net/151662/shazam-unveils-app-redesign/</ref>  \n\nIn July of 2014, Shazam announced the launch of Shazam for Mac, a desktop version of the app, which when enabled, runs in the background and automatically recognizes any song played on or near the computer, including songs playing in the background of TV shows or YouTube videos.<ref>http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/shazam-mac-app/</ref> Apple\xe2\x80\x99s launch of iOS 8 in September of 2014 came with the seamless integration of Shazam into Apple\xe2\x80\x99s intelligent personal assistant Siri function.<ref>http://www.jbgnews.com/2014/09/shazam-partners-with-apple-to-bring-music-recognition-to-siri/504608.html</ref> \n\n==Devices==\nShazam is a free or low-cost application that runs on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]] iOS, [[BlackBerry]] OS, and [[Windows Phone|Windows]] systems. The application is similar on most phones and the result is shown on the screen complete with details on Artist, Album, Title, Genre, Music label, lyrics, a thumbnail image of the song/album artwork, links to download the song on [[iTunes]] or the [[Amazon MP3]] store and, where relevant, show the song\'s video on YouTube and give the option of playing the song on [[Rdio]]. Shazam is also available for Mac, as a desktop application.<ref>http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/shazam-mac-app/ </ref> \n\n== Function ==\nShazam works by analyzing the captured sound and seeking a match based on an [[acoustic fingerprint]] in a database of more than 11 million songs.<ref>[//www.shazam.com/music/web/about.html Shazam \xe2\x80\x93 About Shazam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:Spectrogram of violin.png|thumb|A spectrogram of the sound of a violin.]]\n[[File:Target zone2.png|thumb|The target zone of a song scanned by Shazam.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}]]\nShazam identifies songs based on an audio fingerprint based on a time-frequency graph called a [[spectrogram]].\n\nShazam stores a catalogue of audio fingerprints in a database. The user tags a song for 10 seconds and the application creates an audio fingerprint.\n\nOnce it creates the fingerprint of the audio, Shazam starts the search for matches in the database. If there is a match, it returns the information to the user; otherwise it returns a "song not known" dialogue.<ref>[http://soyoucode.com/2011/how-does-shazam-recognize-song How does Shazam work to recognize a song ? | So, you code ?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShazam can identify prerecorded music being broadcast from any source, such as a radio, television, cinema or music in a club, provided that the background noise level is not high enough to prevent an acoustic fingerprint being taken, and that the song is present in the software\'s database.\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded in 1999 by Barton and Inghelbrecht, who were students at [[University of California, Berkeley]], and Mukherjee, who worked at a London-based internet consulting firm called Viant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} In need of a digital signal processing specialist, the founding team then hired Wang, who was a PhD student from [[Stanford University]]. {{as of|September 2012}}, Wang is the only member of the original team to remain in the company,<ref name="DirectorDec2009" /> and serves as Shazam\'s Chief Scientist.<ref name="Shazam Team">{{cite web|title=About Shazam \xe2\x80\x93 Team|url=//www.shazam.com/music/web/team.html|accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Rich Riley]] joined Shazam as CEO in April 2013 to increase the company\xe2\x80\x99s growth,<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/30/shazam-rich-riley_n_3762179.html</ref> after over 13 years at Yahoo!<ref>http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1560025/shazam-names-rich-riley-new-ceo-aiming-for-eventual-ipo </ref> and with more than 17 years of experience as an entrepreneur and leading Internet executive.<ref>http://www.crunchbase.com/person/rich-riley </ref> "I look forward to extending our dominance in media engagement, from our roots in music to our leadership position in second-screen TV and want to ensure that Shazam is the company that helps people recognize and engage with the world around them,\xe2\x80\x9d Riley said in a statement at the time.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1560025/shazam-names-rich-riley-new-ceo-aiming-for-eventual-ipo </ref> Riley replaced Andrew Fisher, who was hired from [[Infospace]] into the CEO role in 2005 to strengthen industry partnerships and grow the userbase.<ref name=DirectorDec2009 /> Fisher is now executive chairman.\n\n===Partnerships===\nThe first partnership was with Entertainment UK, part of Woolworths, whom they approached to digitise their music catalogue of 1.5 million songs in return for permission to create a proprietary database.

S'The \'\'\'International Society for Music Information Retrieval\'\'\' (\'\'\'ISMIR\'\'\') is an international forum for research on the organization of music-related data. It started as an informal group steered by an \'\'ad hoc\'\' committee in 2000<ref>[http://www.ismir.net/texts/Byrd02.html Donald Byrd and Michael Fingerhut: \'\'The History of ISMIR - A Short Happy Tale\'\'. D-Lib Magazine, Vol. 8 No. 11 ISSN: 1082-9873.]</ref> which established a yearly symposium - whence "ISMIR", which meant \'\'\'International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval\'\'\'. It was turned into a conference in 2002 while retaining the acronym. ISMIR was incorporated in Canada on July 4, 2008.<ref>[http://www.ismir.net/ISMIR-Letters-Patent.pdf ISMIR Letters Patent. Canada, July 4, 2008.]</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nGiven the tremendous growth of digital music and music metadata in recent years, methods for effectively extracting, searching, and organizing music information have received widespread interest from academia and the information and entertainment industries. The purpose of ISMIR is to provide a venue for the exchange of news, ideas, and results through the presentation of original theoretical or practical work. By bringing together researchers and developers, educators and librarians, students and professional users, all working in fields that contribute to this multidisciplinary domain, the conference also serves as a discussion forum, provides introductory and in-depth information on specific domains, and showcases current products.\n\nAs the term Music Information Retrieval (MIR) indicates, this research is motivated by the desire to provide music lovers, music professionals and music industry with robust, effective and usable methods and tools to help them locate, retrieve and experience the music they wish to have access to. MIR is a truly interdisciplinary area, involving researchers from the disciplines of musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science and many others.\n\n==Annual Conference==\nSince its inception in 2000, ISMIR has been the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading forum for research on the modelling, creation, searching, processing and use of musical data. Researchers across the globe meet at the annual conference conducted by the society. It is known by the same acronym as the society, ISMIR.

Pitkow et al. describe two general approaches to personalizing search results, one involving modifying the user\xe2\x80\x99s query and the other re-ranking search results.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pitokow|first=James|author2=Hinrich Sch\xc3\xbctze |author3=Todd Cass |author4=Rob Cooley |author5=Don Turnbull |author6=Andy Edmonds |author7=Eytan Adar |author8=Thomas Breuel |title=Personalized search|journal=Communications of the ACM (CACM)|year=2002|volume=45|issue=9|pages=50\xe2\x80\x9355|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=567498.567526}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nGoogle introduced Personalized search in 2004 and it was implemented in 2005 to Google search. Google has personalized search set up for not just those who have a Google account but everyone as well. There is not very much information on how exactly Google personalizes their searches, however, it is believed that they use user language, location, and web history.<ref>http://personalization.ccs.neu.edu/paper.pdf</ref>\n\nEarly search engines, like [[Yahoo!]] and [[AltaVista]], found results based only on key words. Personalized search, as pioneered by [[Google]], has become far more complex with the goal to "understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want."<ref>{{citation | last=Remerowski|first=Ted|title=National Geographic: Inside Google|year=2013}}</ref> Using mathematical algorithms, search engines are now able to return results based on the number of links to an from sites; the more links a site has, the higher it is placed on the page.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Remerowski|first=Ted|title=National Geographic: Inside Google|year=2013}}</ref> Search engines have two degrees of expertise: the shallow expert and the deep expert. An expert from the shallowest degree serves as a witness who knows some specific information on a given event. A deep expert, on the other hand, has comprehensible knowledge that gives it the capacity to deliver unique information that is relevant to each individual inquirer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Thomas|title=Evaluating Google as an epistemic tool|journal=Metaphilosophy|year=2012|volume=43|issue=4|pages=969\xe2\x80\x93982}}</ref> If a person knows what he or she wants than the search engine will act as a shallow expert and simply locate that information. But search engines are also capable of deep expertise in that they rank results  indicating that those near the top are more relevant to a user\'s wants than those below.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Thomas|title=Evaluating Google as an epistemic tool|journal=Metaphilosophy|year=2012|volume=43|issue=4|pages=969\xe2\x80\x93982}}</ref>\n\nWhile many [[search engines]] take advantage of information about people in general, or about specific groups of people, personalized search depends on a user profile that is unique to the individual. Research systems that personalize search results model their users in different ways. Some rely on users explicitly specifying their interests or on demographic/cognitive characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=Z.|author2=Pant, G. |author3=Sheng, O. |title=Interest-based personalized search.|journal=ACM TOIS|year=2007|volume=25|issue=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Frias-Martinez|first=E.|author2=Chen, S.Y. |author3=Liu, X. |title=Automatic cognitive style identification of digital library users for personalization.|journal=JASIST|year=2007|volume=58|issue=2|pages=237\xe2\x80\x93251|doi=10.1002/asi.20477}}</ref> But user supplied information can be hard to collect and keep up to date. Others have built implicit user models based on content the user has read or their history of interaction with Web pages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chirita|first=P.|author2=Firan, C. |author3=Nejdl, W. |title=Summarizing local context to personalize global Web search|journal=SIGIR|year=2006|pages=287\xe2\x80\x93296}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dou|first=Z.|author2=Song, R. |author3=Wen, J.R. |title=A large-scale evaluation and analysis of personalized search strategies|journal=WWW|year=2007|pages=581\xe2\x80\x93590}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=X.|coauthors=Tan, B. and Zhai, C.X.|title=Implicit user modeling for personalized search|journal=CIKM|year=2005|pages=824\xe2\x80\x93831}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sugiyama|first=K.|author2=Hatano, K. |author3=Yoshikawa, M. |title=Adaptive web search based on user profile constructed without any effort from the user|journal=WWW|year=2004|pages=675\xe2\x80\x93684}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Teevan|first=J.|author2=Dumais, S.T. |author3=Horvitz, E. |title=Personalizing search via automated analysis of interests and activities|journal=SIGIR|year=2005|pages=415\xe2\x80\x93422|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/teevan/work/publications/papers/tochi10.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere are several publicly available systems for personalizing Web search results (e.g., [[Google Personalized Search]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]]\'s search result personalization<ref>{{cite web|last=Crook|first=Aidan, and Sanaz Ahari|title=Making search yours|url=http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/10/making-search-yours.aspx|publisher=Bing|accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>). However, the technical details and evaluations of these commercial systems are proprietary. One technique Google uses to personalize searches for its users is to track log in time and if the user has enabled web history in his browser. The more you keep going the same site through a search result from Google, it believes that you like that page. So when you do certain searches, Google\'s personalized search algorithm gives the page a boost, moving it up through the ranks. Even if you\'re signed out, Google may personalize your results because it keeps a 180 day record of what a particular web browser has searched for, linked to a cookie in that browser.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|title=Of "Magic Keywords" and Flavors Of Personalized Search At Google|url=http://searchengineland.com/flavors-of-google-personalized-search-139286|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn order to better understand how personalized search results are being presented to the users, a group of researchers at Northeastern University set out to answer this question. By comparing an aggregate set of searches from logged in users against a control group, the research team found that 11.7% of results show differences due to personalization, however this varies widely by search query and result ranking position.<ref>{{cite web|last=Briggs|first=Justin|title=A Better Understanding of Personalized Search|url=http://justinbriggs.org/better-understanding-personalized-search|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> Of various factors tested, the two that had measurable impact were being logged in with a Google account and the IP address of the searching users. It should also be noted that results with high degress of personalization include companies and politics. One of the factors driving personalization is localization of results, with company queries showing store locations relevant to the location of the user. So, for example, if you searched for "used car sales", Google may churn out results of local car dealerships in your area. On the other hand, queries with the least amount of personalization include factual queries ("what is") and health.<ref>{{cite web|last=Briggs|first=Justin|title=A Better Understanding of Personalized Search|url=http://justinbriggs.org/better-understanding-personalized-search|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen measuring personalization, it is important to eliminate background noise. In this context, one type of background noise is the carry-over effect. The carry-over effect can be defined as follows: when you perform a search and follow it with a subsequent search, the results of the second search is influenced by the first search. An interesting point to note is that the top ranked URLs are less likely to change based off personalization, with most personalization occurring at the lower ranks. This is a style of personalization, based on recent search history, but it is not a consistent element of personalization because the phenomenon times out after 10 minutes, according to the researchers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Briggs|first=Justin|title=A Better Understanding of Personalized Search|url=http://justinbriggs.org/better-understanding-personalized-search|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==The Filter Bubble==\n{{Main|Filter bubble}}\n\nSeveral concerns have been brought up regarding personalized search. It decreases the likelihood of finding new information by biasing search results towards what the user has already found. It introduces potential privacy problems in which a user may not be aware that their search results are personalized for them, and wonder why the things that they are interested in have become so relevant. Such a problem has been coined as the "filter bubble" by author [[Eli Pariser]]. He argues that people are letting major websites drive their destiny and make decisions based on the vast amount of data they\'ve collected on individuals. This can isolate users in their own worlds or "filter bubbles" where they only see information that they want to, such a consequence of "The Friendly World Syndrome." As a result people are much less informed of problems in the developing world which can further widen the gap between the North (developed countries) and the South (developing countries).<ref>{{cite book|last=Pariser|first=Eli|title=The Filter Bubble|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe methods of personalization, and how useful it is to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote\xe2\x80\x9d certain results which have been showing up regularly in searches by like-minded individuals in the same community. The personalization method makes it very easy to understand how the Filter Bubble happens. As certain results are bumped up and viewed more by individuals, other results not favored by them are relegated to obscurity. As this happens on a community-wide level, it results in the community, consciously or not, sharing a skewed perspective of events.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smyth|first=B.|title=Adaptive Information Access:: Personalization And Privacy |journal=International Journal Of Pattern Recognition & Artificial Intelligence |year=2007|pages=183\xe2\x80\x93205}}</ref>\n\nAn area of particular concern to some parts of the world is the use of personalized search as a form of control over the people utilizing the search by only giving them particular information. This can be used to give particular influence over highly talked about topics such as gun control or even gear people to side with a particular political regime in different countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pariser|first=Eli|title=The Filter Bubble|year=2011}}</ref> While total control by a particular government just from personalized search is a stretch, control of the information readily available from searches can easily be controlled by the richest corporations. The biggest example of a corporation controlling the information is Google. Google is not only feeding you the information they want but they are at times using your personalized search to gear you towards their own companies or affiliates. This has led to a complete control of various parts of the web and a pushing out of their competitors such as how Google Maps took a major control over the online map and direction industry with MapQuest and others forced to take a backseat.<ref>http://{{cite web| title=Traffic Report: How Google is squeezing out competitors and muscling into new markets|url= http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/TrafficStudy-Google.pdf|accessdate= 27 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany search engines use concept-based user profiling strategies that derive only topics that users are highly interested in but for best results, according to researchers Wai-Tin and Dik Lun, both positive and negative preferences should be considered. Such profiles, applying negative and positive preferences, result in highest quality and most relevant results by separating alike queries from unalike queries. For example, typing in \'apple\' could refer to either the fruit or the [[Macintosh]] computer and providing both preferences aids search engines\' ability to learn which apple the user is really looking for based on the links clicked. One concept-strategy the researchers came up with to improve personalized search and yield both positive and negative preferences is the click-based method. This method captures a user\'s interests based on which links they click on in a results list, while downgrading unclicked links.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wai-Tin|first=Kenneth|coauthors=Dik Lun, L|title=Deriving concept-based user profiles from search engine logs|journal=IEE transaction on knowledge and data engineering|year=2010|volume=22|issue=7|pages=969\xe2\x80\x93982|doi=10.1109/tkde.2009.144}}</ref>\n\nThe feature also has profound effects on the [[search engine optimization]] industry, due to the fact that search results will no longer be ranked the same way for every user.<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/120709-google-personalized-results-could-be.html "Google Personalized Results Could Be Bad for Search"]. \'\'Network World\'\'. Retrieved July 12, 2010.</ref> An example of this is found in Eli Pariser\'s, The Filter Bubble, where he had two friends type in "BP" into Google\'s search bar. One friend found information on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico while the other retrieved investment information.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pariser|first=Eli|title=The Filter Bubble|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nSome have noted that personalized search results not only serve to customize a user\'s search results, but also [[Advertising|advertisements]].  This has been criticized as an [[Expectation of privacy|invasion on privacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seooptimizers.com/search-engines-and-customized-results-based-on-your-internet-history.html|title=Search Engines and Customized Results Based on Your Internet History|publisher=SEO Optimizers|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==The Case of Google==\n{{Main|Google Personalized Search}}\n\nThe perfect example of search personalization is [[Google]]. Google is not just a search engine, but a corporation that is entering every facet of our lives. Personalization with Google has gone far beyond just search. There are a host of new applications, all of which can be personalized and integrated with the help of a Google account. Personalizing search does not require an account. However, one is almost deprived a choice, since so many useful Google products are only accessible if one has a Google account. The Google Dashboard, introduced in 2009, covers more than 20 products and services, including Gmail, Calendar, Docs, YouTube, etc.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mattison|first=D.|title=Time, Space, And Google: Toward A Real-Time, Synchronous, Personalized, Collaborative Web. |journal=Searcher|year=2010|pages=20\xe2\x80\x9331}}</ref> that keeps track of all the information directly under one\xe2\x80\x99s name. The free Google Custom Search is available for individuals and big companies alike, providing the Search facility for individual websites and powering corporate sites such as that of the [[New York Times]]. The high level of personalization that was available with Google played a significant part in helping remain the world\xe2\x80\x99s most favorite search engine.\n\nOne large example of Google\xe2\x80\x99s ability to personalized search is in its use of Google News. Google has geared its news to show everyone a few similar articles that can be deemed as interesting, but as soon as the user scrolls down, it can be seen that the news articles begin to differ. Google takes into account past searches as well as the location of the user to make sure that local news gets to them first. This can lead to a much easier search and less time going through all of the news to find the information you want. The concern, however, is that the very important information can be held back because it does not match with the criteria that the program sets for the particular user. This can create the \xe2\x80\x9c[[filter bubble]]\xe2\x80\x9d as described earlier.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pariser|first=Eli|title=The Filter Bubble|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting point about personalization that often gets overlooked is the privacy vs personalization battle. While the two do not have to be mutually exclusive, it is often the case that as one becomes more prominent, it compromises the other. Google provides a host of services to people, and many of these services do not require information to be collected about a person to be customizable. Since there is no threat of privacy invasion with these services, the balance has been tipped to favor personalization over privacy, even when it comes to search. As people reap the rewards of convenience from customizing their other Google services, they desire better search results, even if it comes at the expense of private information. Where to draw the line between the information versus search results tradeoff, is new territory and Google gets to make that decision. Until people get the power to control the information that is being collected about them, Google is not truly protecting privacy.\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s popularity as a search engine and Internet browser has allowed it to gain a lot of power. Their popularity has created millions of usernames, which have been used to collect vast amounts of information about individuals. Google can use multiple methods of personalization such as traditional, social, geographic, IP address, browser, cookies, time of day, year, behavioral, query history, bookmarks, and more. Although many people would say that having Google personalize your search results based on what you searched previously would be a good thing, there are negatives that come with it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Mark|title=The Future of Google\'s Search Personalization|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2067001/The-Future-of-Googles-Search-Personalization|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Harry|first=David|title=Search Personalization and the User Experience|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2118126/Search-Personalization-the-User-Experience|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>\nWith the power from this information, Google has chosen to bully its way into other sectors it owned such as videos, document sharing, shopping, maps, and many more. Google has done this by steering searchers to their own services offered as opposed to others such as MapQuest.\n\nUsing Search Personalization, Google has doubled its video market share to about eighty percent. The legal definition of a monopoly is when a firm gains control of seventy to eighty percent of the market. Google has reinforced this monopoly by creating significant barriers of entry such as manipulating search results to show their own services. This can be clearly seen with Google Maps being the first thing displayed in most searches.\n\nThe analytical firm Experian Hitwise stated that since two thousand and seven, MapQuest has had its traffic cut in half because of this. Other statistics from around the same time include Photobucket going from twenty percent of market share to only three percent, Myspace going from twelve percent market share to less than one percent, and ESPN from eight percent to four percent market share. In terms of images, Photobucket went from thirty one percent in two thousand and seven to ten percent in two thousand and ten. Even Yahoo Images has gone from twelve percent to seven percent. It becomes very apparent that the decline of these companies has come because of Google\xe2\x80\x99s increase in market share from forty three percent in two thousand and seven to about fifty five percent in two thousand and nine.\n\nIt might be easy to say that all of this has come from Google being more dominant because they provide better services. However, Experian Hitwise has also created graphs to show the market share of about fifteen different companies at once. This has been done for every category for the market share of pictures, videos, product search, and more. The graph for product search is evidence enough for Google\xe2\x80\x99s bullying because their numbers went from one point three million unique visitors to eleven point nine unique visitors in one month. That kind of growth can only come with the change of a process.\n\nIn the end, there are two things in common theme with all of these graphs. The first is that Google\xe2\x80\x99s market share has a directly inverse relationship to the market share of the leading competitors. The second is that this directly inverse relationship began around two thousand and seven, which is around the time that Google began to use its \xe2\x80\x9cUniversal Search\xe2\x80\x9d method.<ref>{{cite web|title=TRAFFIC REPORT:How Google is Squeezing out Competitors and Muscling into New Markets |url=https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/226148/mod_resource/content/1/TrafficStudy-Google.pdf|publisher=ConsumerWatchDog.org|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n\nOne of the most critical benefits personalized search has is to improve the quality of decisions consumers make. The internet has made the transaction cost of obtaining information significantly lower than ever. However, human\xe2\x80\x99s capability of processing information has not expanded much.<ref>Diehl, K. (2003). Personalization and Decision Support Tools: Effects on Search and Consumer Decision Making. Advances In Consumer Research, 30(1), 166-169.</ref> When facing overwhelming amount of information, consumers need a sophisticated tool to help them make high quality decisions. Two studies examined the effects of personalized screening and ordering tools, and the results show positive correlation between personalized search and the quality of consumers\xe2\x80\x99 decisions.\n\nThe first study was conducted by Kristin Diehl from University of South Carolina. Her research discovered that reducing search cost led to lower quality choices. The reason behind this discovery was that \xe2\x80\x98consumers make worse choices because lower search costs cause them to consider inferior options.\xe2\x80\x99 It also showed that if consumers have a specific goal in mind, they would further their search, resulting in an even worse decision.<ref>Diehl, K. (2003). Personalization and Decision Support Tools: Effects on Search and Consumer Decision Making. Advances In Consumer Research, 30(1), 166-169.</ref> The study by Gerald Haubl from University of Alberta and Benedict G.C. Dellaert from Maastricht University mainly focused on recommendation systems. Both studies concluded that a personalized search and recommendation system significantly improved consumers\xe2\x80\x99 decision quality and reduced the number of products inspected.<ref>Diehl, K. (2003). Personalization and Decision Support Tools: Effects on Search and Consumer Decision Making. Advances In Consumer Research, 30(1), 166-169.</ref>\n\n==Models==\n\nPersonalized search gains popularity because of the demand for more relevant information. Research has indicated low success rates among major search engines in providing relevant results; in 52% of 20,000 queries, searchers did not find any relevant results within the documents that Google returned.<ref>Coyle, M., & Smyth, B. (2007). Information recovery and discovery in collaborative web search. Advances in Information Retrieval (pp. 356\xe2\x80\x93367).</ref> Personalized search can improve search quality significantly and there are mainly two ways to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first model available is based on the users\xe2\x80\x99 historical searches and search locations. People are probably familiar with this model since they often find the results reflecting their current location and previous searches.\n\nThere is another way to personalize search results. In Bracha Shapira and Boaz Zabar\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPersonalized Search: Integrating Collaboration and Social Networks\xe2\x80\x9d, Shapira and Zabar focused on a model that utilizes a recommendation system.<ref>Shapira, B., & Zabar, B. (2011). Personalized search: Integrating collaboration and social networks. Journal Of The American Society For Information Science & Technology, 62(1), 146-160. doi:10.1002/asi.21446</ref> This model shows results of other users who have searched for similar keywords. The authors examined keyword search, the recommendation system, and the recommendation system with social network working separately and compares the results in terms of search quality. The results show that a personalized search engine with the recommendation system produces better quality results than the standard search engine, and that the recommendation system with social network even improves more.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nWhile there are documented benefits of the implementation of search personalization, there are also arguments against its use. The foundation of this argument against its use is because it confines internet users\xe2\x80\x99 search engine results to material that aligns with the users\xe2\x80\x99 interests and history. It limits the users\xe2\x80\x99 ability to become exposed to material that would be relevant to the user\xe2\x80\x99s search query but due to the fact that some of this material differs from the user\xe2\x80\x99s interests and history, the material is not displayed to the user. Search personalization takes the objectivity out of the search engine and undermines the engine. \xe2\x80\x9cObjectivity matters little when you know what you are looking for, but its lack is problematic when you do not\xe2\x80\x9d.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Thomas W.|title=Evaluating Google As An Epistemic Tool|journal=Metaphilosophy|date=2012|volume=43.4|pages=426\xe2\x80\x93445|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01759.x}}</ref>  One of the main functions of the internet is the collection and sharing of information. This is the criticism of search personalization. It limits a core function of the web. It helps prevent users from easily accessing all the possible information that is available for a specific search query.  Search personalization adds a bias to user\xe2\x80\x99s search queries. If a user has a particular set of interests or internet history and uses the web to research a controversial issue. The user\xe2\x80\x99s search results will reflect that. The user not be displayed both sides of the issue if the user\xe2\x80\x99s interests lean to one side or another. The user may be missing out on information that could be important. A study done on search personalization and its effects on search results in Google News resulted in different orders of news stories being generated by different users even though each user entered the same search query. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I further distilled the results, I saw that only 12% of the searchers had the same three stories in the same order. This to me is prima facie evidence that there is filtering going on\xe2\x80\x9d.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Mary Ellen|title=Is Google Hiding My News?|year=2011|volume=35.6}}</ref> If search personalization was not active, all the results in theory should have been the same stories in an identical order.\n\nAnother disadvantage of search personalization is that internet companies such as Google are gathering and potentially selling your internet interests and histories to other companies. This raises a privacy issue. The issue is if people are content with companies gather and selling their internet information without their consent or knowledge.  Many web users are unaware of the use of search personalization and even fewer have knowledge that user data is a valuable commodity for internet companies.\n\n==Sites that use Personalized Search==\n\nE. Pariser author of the Filter Bubble explains how there are differences that search personalization has on both Facebook and Google. Facebook implements personalization when it comes to the amount of things we share and also what pages we \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d. It also takes into consideration our social interactions, whose profile we visit the most, who we message or chat with are all indicators that are used when Facebook uses personalization. Rather than what we share being an indicator of what is filtered out, but Google takes into consideration what we \xe2\x80\x9cclick\xe2\x80\x9d to filter out what comes up in our searches. In addition Facebook searches are not necessarily as private as the Google ones. Facebook draws on the more public self and we share what other people want to see. Even while tagging photographs, Facebook uses personalization and recognition that will automatically assign a name to face for you without you having to tag them. In terms of Google we are provided similar websites and resources based on what we initially click on. This doesn\'t just affect Google and Facebook. There are even other websites that use the filter tactic to better adhere to user preferences. For example, Netflix also judges from the users search history to suggest movies that they may be interested in for the future. There are cites like Amazon and personal shopping cites also use other peoples history in order to serve their interests better. Twitter also uses personalization by \xe2\x80\x9csuggesting\xe2\x80\x9d other people to follow. In addition, based on who we \xe2\x80\x9cfollow\xe2\x80\x9d and who we \xe2\x80\x9ctweet\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cretweet\xe2\x80\x9d at Twitter filters out to peoples best interest for us.  Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, believed that we only have one identity. E. Pariser argues that is completely false and search personalization is just another way to prove that isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. Although personalized search may seem helpful it is not a very accurate representation of who we are as people. There are instances where people also search things and share things in order to make themselves look better. For example, someone may look up and share political articles and other intellectual articles in order to make themselves look better. Search personalization is not an ideal representation of any person. There are so many cites used for different purposes and that does not make up one person\xe2\x80\x99s identity at all that, but are in fact false representations of ourselves.<ref>http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~jbl00001/pariser_the%20filter%20bubble_introduction.pdf</ref>\n\n==Personalized Search and Online Shopping==\n\nSearch engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, utilize personalized search to attract possible customers to products that fit their presumed desires. Based on a large amount of collected data aggregated from an individual\xe2\x80\x99s web clicks, search engines can use personalized search to put forth advertisements that may pique the interest of an individual. Utilizing personalized search can help consumers find what they want faster, as well as help match up products and services to individuals within more specialized and/or niche markets. Many of these products or services that are sold via personalized online results would struggle to sell in brick-and-mortar stores. These types of products and services are called long tail items.<ref>Badke, William. \xe2\x80\x9cPersonalization and Information Literacy\xe2\x80\x9d. Online, 47. Feb. 2012.</ref> Using personalized search allows faster product and service discoveries for consumers, and reduces the amount of necessary advertisement money spent to reach those consumers. In addition, utilizing personalized search can help companies determine which individuals should be offered online coupon codes to their products and/or services. By tracking if an individual has perused their website, considered purchasing an item, or has previously made a purchase a company can post advertisements on other websites to reach that particular consumer in an attempt to have them make a purchase.\n\nAside from aiding consumers and businesses in finding one-another, the search engines that provide personalized search benefit greatly. The more data collected on an individual, the more personalized results will be. In turn, this allows search engines to sell more advertisements because companies understand that they will have a better opportunity to sell to high percentage matched individuals then medium and low percentage matched individuals. This aspect of personalized search angers many scholars, such as William Badke and Eli Pariser, because they believe personalized search is driven by the desire to increase advertisement revenues. In addition, they believe that personalized search results are frequently utilized to sway individuals into using products and services that are offered by the particular search engine company or any other company in partnered with them. For example, Google searching any company with at least one brick-and-mortar location will offer a map portraying the closest company location using the Google Maps service as the first result to the query.<ref>Inside Google. "Traffic Report: How Google Is Squeezing Out Competitors and Muscling Into New Markets." Consumer Watchdog. http://www.consumerwatchdog.org, 2 June 2010. Web.</ref> In order to use other mapping services, such as MapQuest, a user would have to dig deeper into the results. Another example pertains to more vague queries. Searching the word \xe2\x80\x9cshoes\xe2\x80\x9d using the Google search engine will offer several advertisements to shoe companies that pay Google to link their website as a first result to consumer\xe2\x80\x99s queries.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Personalized search}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Internet search engines| ]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Personalized search|*]]'

Personalization implies that the changes are based on implicit data, such as items purchased or pages viewed. The term \'\'customization\'\' is used instead when the site only uses explicit data such as ratings or preferences. \n\nOn an [[intranet]] or [[B2E]] [[Web portal#Enterprise Web portals|Enterprise Web portals]], personalization is often based on user attributes such as department, functional area, or role.  The term \'\'\'customization\'\'\' in this context refers to the ability of users to modify the page layout or specify what content should be displayed.\n\nThere are three categories of personalization:\n# Profile / Group based\n# Behaviour based (also known as Wisdom of the Crowds)\n# Collaboration based\n\n\n\nThere are three broad methods of personalization:\n# Implicit\n# Explicit\n# Hybrid\n\nWith implicit personalization the personalization is performed by the web page (or information system) based on the different categories mentioned above. It can also be learned from interactions with the user directly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Lawrence|title=5 Things To Know About Siri And Google Now\'s Growing Intelligence|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/07/08/5-things-to-know-about-siri-and-google-nows-growing-intelligence/|website=Forbes}}</ref> With explicit personalization, the web page (or information system) is changed by the user using the features provided by the system.\nHybrid personalization combines the above two approaches to leverage the \'\'best of both worlds\'\'.\n\nMany companies offer services for web recommendation and email recommendation that are based on personalization or anonymously collected user behaviors.<ref name=behaviors>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198.html?mod=googlenews_wsj \'\'Wall Street Journal\'\', \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Web\'s Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only\xe2\x80\x9d], August 4, 2010</ref>  \n\nWeb personalization is closely linked to the notion of \'\'\'[[Adaptive hypermedia]]\'\'\' (AH). The main difference is that the former would usually work on what is considered an Open Corpus Hypermedia, whilst the latter would traditionally work on Closed Corpus Hypermedia. However, recent research directions in the AH domain take both closed and open corpus into account. Thus, the two fields are closely inter-related.\n\nPersonalization is also being considered for use in less overtly commercial applications to improve the user experience online.<ref>[[Jonathan Bowen|Bowen, J.P.]] and Filippini-Fantoni, S., [http://www.archimuse.com/mw2004/papers/bowen/bowen.html Personalization and the Web from a Museum Perspective].

Pariser warns that these algorithms can create a "[[filter bubble]]" that prevents people from encountering a diversity of viewpoints beyond their own, or which only presents facts which confirm their existing views.\n\n==Digital media==\nAnother aspect of personalization is the increasing prevalence of [[open data]] on the Web. Many companies make their data available on the Web via [[API]]s, web services, and [[open data]] standards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/apr/02/ordnance-survey-open-data | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Chris | last1=Thorpe | first2=Simon | last2=Rogers | title=Ordnance Survey opendata maps: what does it actually include? | date=2 April 2010}}</ref> Ordnance Survey Open Data This data is structured to allow it to be inter-connected and re-used by third parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/372363/Google_Opens_Up_Data_Center_For_Third_Party_Web_Applications |title=Google Opens Up Data Centre for Third Party Web Applications |publisher=Cio.com |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>\n\nData available from a user\xe2\x80\x99s personal [[social graph]] can be accessed by third-party [[application software]] to be suited to fit the personalized [[web page]] or [[information appliance]].\n\nCurrent [[open data]] standards on the Web include:\n# [[Attention Profiling Mark-up Language]] (APML)\n# [[DataPortability]]\n# [[OpenID]]\n# [[OpenSocial]]\n\n== Mobile phones ==\n\nOver time mobile phones have seen an increased emphasis placed on user personalization. Far from the black and white screens and monophonic ringtones of the past, phones now offer interactive wallpapers and MP3 TruTones. In the UK and Asia, WeeMees have become popular. WeeMees are three-dimensional characters that are used as wallpaper and respond to the tendencies of the user. Video Graphics Array (VGA) picture quality allows people to change their background with ease without sacrificing quality. All of these services are downloaded through the provider with the goal to make the user feel connected to the phone.<ref>May, Harvey, and Greg Hearn. "The Mobile Phone as Media."

Print.</ref>\n\n==Print media==\n{{main|Mail merge}}\n\nIn print media, ranging from [[magazine]]s to [[admail|promotional publication]]s, personalization uses databases of individual recipients\xe2\x80\x99 information. Not only does the written document address itself by name to the reader, but the advertising is targeted to the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s demographics or interests using fields within the database, such as "first name", "last name", "company", etc. \n\nThe term "personalization" should not be confused with variable data, which is a much more granular method of marketing that leverages both images and text with the medium, not just fields within a database. Although personalized children\'s books are created by companies who are using and leveraging all the strengths of [[variable data printing| variable data printing (VDP)]]. This allows for full image and text variability within a printed book.\nWith the advent of online 3D printing services such as Shapeways and Ponoko we are seeing personalization enter into the realms of product design.\n\n== Promotional merchandise ==\nPromotional items ([[mug]]s, [[T-shirt]]s, [[keychain]]s, [[ball]]s etc.) are regularly personalized. Personalized children\xe2\x80\x99s storybooks \xe2\x80\x94 wherein the child becomes the [[protagonist]], with the name and image of the child personalized \xe2\x80\x94 are also popular. Personalized CDs for children also exist. With the advent of [[digital printing]], personalized calendars that start in any month, birthday cards, cards, e-cards, posters and photo books can also be obtained. In addition, with the advent of [[3D printing]], personalised apparel and accessories, such as jewellery made by [[StyleRocks]], is also increasing in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewellermagazine.com/Article.aspx?id=2167&h=New-jewellery-website-targets-|title=New jewellery website targets \'customisers\'|last=Weinman|first=Aaron|date=21 February 2012|publisher=Jeweller Magazine|language=|accessdate=6 January 2015|quote=StyleRocks founder and CEO, Pascale Helyar-Moray, said the site offers women\xe2\x80\x99s and men\xe2\x80\x99s rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings and cufflinks.

S'{{Too many see alsos|date=December 2012}}\n\'\'\'Search engine indexing\'\'\' collects, parses, and stores [[data (computing)|data]] to facilitate fast and accurate [[information retrieval]]. Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, [[Information technology|informatics]], and computer science.  An alternate name for the process in the context of [[search engine]]s designed to find web pages on the Internet is \'\'[[web indexing]]\'\'.\n\nPopular engines focus on the full-text indexing of online, natural language documents.<ref>Clarke, C., Cormack, G.: Dynamic Inverted Indexes for a Distributed Full-Text Retrieval System. TechRep MT-95-01, University of Waterloo, February 1995.</ref> [[Multimedia|Media types]] such as video and audio<ref>http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf</ref> and graphics<ref>Charles E. Jacobs, Adam Finkelstein, David H. Salesin. [http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/query/mrquery.pdf Fast Multiresolution Image Querying]. Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington. 1995. Verified Dec 2006</ref> are also searchable.\n\n[[Metasearch engine|Meta search engines]] reuse the indices of other services and do not store a local index, whereas cache-based search engines permanently store the index along with the  [[text corpus|corpus]]. Unlike full-text indices, partial-text services restrict the depth indexed to reduce index size. Larger services typically perform indexing at a predetermined time interval due to the required time and processing costs, while [[Intelligent agent|agent]]-based search engines index in [[Real time business intelligence|real time]].\n\n==Indexing==\nThe purpose of storing an index is to optimize speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a search query. Without an index, the search engine would [[Lexical analysis|scan]] every document in the corpus, which would require considerable time and computing power.  For example, while an index of 10,000 documents can be queried within milliseconds, a sequential scan of every word in 10,000 large documents could take hours. The additional computer storage required to store the index, as well as the considerable increase in the time required for an update to take place, are traded off for the time saved during information retrieval.\n\n===Index design factors===\nMajor factors in designing a search engine\'s architecture include:\n\n; Merge factors : How data enters the index, or how words or subject features are added to the index during text corpus traversal, and whether multiple indexers can work asynchronously. The indexer must first check whether it is updating old content or adding new content. Traversal typically correlates to the [[Web crawling|data collection]] policy. Search engine index merging is similar in concept to the [[Merge (SQL)|SQL Merge]] command and other merge algorithms.<ref>Brown, E.W.: Execution Performance Issues in Full-Text Information Retrieval. Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Technical Report 95-81, October 1995.</ref>\n; Storage techniques : How to store the index [[data]], that is, whether information should be data compressed or filtered.\n; Index size : How much computer storage is required to support the index.\n; Lookup speed : How quickly a word can be found in the inverted index. The speed of finding an entry in a data structure, compared with how quickly it can be updated or removed, is a central focus of computer science.\n; Maintenance : How the index is maintained over time.<ref>Cutting, D., Pedersen, J.: Optimizations for dynamic inverted index maintenance. Proceedings of SIGIR, 405-411, 1990.</ref>\n;Fault tolerance : How important it is for the service to be reliable. Issues include dealing with index corruption, determining whether bad data can be treated in isolation, dealing with bad hardware, [[partition (database)|partitioning]], and schemes such as [[hash function|hash-based]] or composite partitioning,<ref>[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/partitioning-linear-hash.html Linear Hash Partitioning]. MySQL 5.1 Reference Manual. Verified Dec 2006</ref> as well as [[Replication (computer science)|replication]].\n\n===Index data structures===\nSearch engine architectures vary in the way indexing is performed and in methods of index storage to meet the various design factors.\n\n;[[Suffix tree]] : Figuratively structured like a tree, supports linear time lookup. Built by storing the suffixes of words. The suffix tree is a type of [[trie]]. Tries support extendable hashing, which is important for search engine indexing.<ref>[http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/trie.html trie], [http://www.nist.gov/dads Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures], [http://www.nist.gov U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology].</ref> Used for searching for patterns in [[DNA]] sequences and clustering.

There are many opportunities for [[race conditions]] and coherent faults. For example, a new document is added to the corpus and the index must be updated, but the index simultaneously needs to continue responding to search queries. This is a collision between two competing tasks. Consider that authors are producers of information, and a web crawler is the consumer of this information, grabbing the text and storing it in a cache (or [[Text corpus|corpus]]). The forward index is the consumer of the information produced by the corpus, and the inverted index is the consumer of information produced by the forward index. This is commonly referred to as a \'\'\'producer-consumer model\'\'\'. The indexer is the producer of searchable information and users are the consumers that need to search.  The challenge is magnified when working with distributed storage and distributed processing. In an effort to scale with larger amounts of indexed information, the search engine\'s architecture may involve [[distributed computing]], where the search engine consists of several machines operating in unison. This increases the possibilities for incoherency and makes it more difficult to maintain a fully synchronized, distributed, parallel architecture.<ref>Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat. MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters. Google, Inc. OSDI. 2004.</ref>\n\n===Inverted indices===\nMany search engines incorporate an [[inverted index]] when evaluating a [[search query]] to quickly locate documents containing the words in a query and then rank these documents by relevance. Because the inverted index stores a list of the documents containing each word, the search engine can use direct [[random access|access]] to find the documents associated with each word in the query in order to retrieve the matching documents quickly. The following is a simplified illustration of an inverted index:\n\n{| align="center" class="wikitable"\n|+ Inverted Index\n|-\n! Word !! Documents\n|-\n| the || Document 1, Document 3, Document 4, Document 5, Document 7\n|-\n| cow || Document 2, Document 3, Document 4\n|-\n| says || Document 5\n|-\n| moo || Document 7\n|}\n\nThis index can only determine whether a word exists within a particular document, since it stores no information regarding the frequency and position of the word; it is therefore considered to be a [[boolean datatype|boolean]] index. Such an index determines which documents match a query but does not rank matched documents. In some designs the index includes additional information such as the frequency of each word in each document or the positions of a word in each document.<ref>Grossman, Frieder, Goharian. [http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~juan/CPSC862/Concept-50/IR-Basics-of-Inverted-Index.pdf IR Basics of Inverted Index]. 2002. Verified Aug 2011.</ref> Position information enables the search algorithm to identify word proximity to support searching for phrases; frequency can be used to help in ranking the relevance of documents to the query. Such topics are the central research focus of [[information retrieval]].\n\nThe inverted index is a [[sparse matrix]], since not all words are present in each document. To reduce computer storage memory requirements, it is stored differently from a two dimensional [[Array data structure|array]]. The index is similar to the [[document-term matrix|term document matrices]] employed by [[latent semantic analysis]]. The inverted index can be considered a form of a hash table. In some cases the index is a form of a [[binary tree]], which requires additional storage but may reduce the lookup time. In larger indices the architecture is typically a [[distributed hash table]].<ref>Tang, Hunqiang. [[Sandhya Dwarkadas|Dwarkadas, Sandhya]]. "Hybrid Global Local Indexing for Efficient\nPeer to Peer Information Retrieval". University of Rochester. Pg 1. http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/sandhya/papers/nsdi04.ps</ref>\n\n===Index merging===\nThe inverted index is filled via a merge or rebuild. A rebuild is similar to a merge but first deletes the contents of the inverted index. The architecture may be designed to support incremental indexing,<ref>Tomasic, A., et al.: Incremental Updates of Inverted Lists for Text Document Retrieval. Short Version of Stanford University Computer Science Technical Note STAN-CS-TN-93-1, December, 1993.</ref> where a merge identifies the document or documents to be added or updated and then parses each document into words. For technical accuracy, a merge conflates newly indexed documents, typically residing in virtual memory, with the index cache residing on one or more computer hard drives.\n\nAfter parsing, the indexer adds the referenced document to the document list for the appropriate words. In a larger search engine, the process of finding each word in the inverted index (in order to report that it occurred within a document) may be too time consuming, and so this process is commonly split up into two parts, the development of a forward index and a process which sorts the contents of the forward index into the inverted index. The inverted index is  so named because it is an inversion of the forward index.\n\n===The forward index===\nThe forward index stores a list of words for each document. The following is a simplified form of the forward index:\n\n{| align="center" class="wikitable"\n|+ Forward Index\n|-\n! Document !! Words\n|-\n| Document 1 || the,cow,says,moo\n|-\n| Document 2 || the,cat,and,the,hat\n|-\n| Document 3 || the,dish,ran,away,with,the,spoon\n|}\n\nThe rationale behind developing a forward index is that as documents are parsing, it is better to immediately store the words per document.  The delineation enables Asynchronous system processing, which partially circumvents the inverted index update [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]].<ref>Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page. [http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine]. [[Stanford University]]. 1998. Verified Dec 2006.</ref> The forward index is [[Sorting algorithm|sorted]] to transform it to an inverted index. The forward index is essentially a list of pairs consisting of a document and a word, collated by the document. Converting the forward index to an inverted index is only a matter of sorting the pairs by the words. In this regard, the inverted index is a word-sorted forward index.\n\n===Compression===\nGenerating or maintaining a large-scale search engine index represents a significant storage and processing challenge. Many search engines utilize a form of compression to reduce the size of the indices on [[computer storage|disk]].<ref>H.S. Heaps. Storage analysis of a compression coding for a document database. 1NFOR, I0(i):47-61, February 1972.</ref> Consider the following scenario for a full text, Internet search engine.\n\n* It takes 8 bits (or 1 [[byte]]) to store a single character. Some [[character encoding|encodings]] use 2 bytes per character<ref>[http://www.unicode.org/faq/basic_q.html#15 The Unicode Standard - Frequently Asked Questions]. Verified Dec 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.uplink.freeuk.com/data.html Storage estimates]. Verified Dec 2006.</ref>\n* The average number of characters in any given word on a page may be estimated at 5 ([[Wikipedia:Size comparisons]])\n\nGiven this scenario, an uncompressed index (assuming a non-[[conflation|conflated]], simple, index) for 2 billion web pages would need to store 500 billion word entries. At 1 byte per character, or 5 bytes per word, this would require 2500 gigabytes of storage space alone. This space requirement may be even larger for a fault-tolerant distributed storage architecture. Depending on the compression technique chosen, the index can be reduced to a fraction of this size. The tradeoff is the time and processing power required to perform compression and decompression.\n\nNotably, large scale search engine designs incorporate the cost of storage as well as the costs of electricity to power the storage. Thus compression is a measure of cost.\n\n==Document parsing==\nDocument parsing breaks apart the components (words) of a document or other form of media for insertion into the forward and inverted indices. The words found are called \'\'tokens\'\', and so, in the context of search engine indexing and [[natural language processing]], parsing is more commonly referred to as [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]]. It is also sometimes called [[word boundary disambiguation]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|tagging]], [[text segmentation]], [[content analysis]], text analysis, [[text mining]], [[Agreement (linguistics)|concordance]] generation, [[speech segmentation]], [[Lexical analysis|lexing]], or [[lexical analysis]]. The terms \'indexing\', \'parsing\', and \'tokenization\' are used interchangeably in corporate slang.\n\nNatural language processing, as of 2006, is the subject of continuous research and technological improvement. Tokenization presents many challenges in extracting the necessary information from documents for indexing to support quality searching. Tokenization for indexing involves multiple technologies, the implementation of which are commonly kept as corporate secrets.\n\n=== Challenges in natural language processing ===\n; Word Boundary Ambiguity : Native [[English language|English]] speakers may at first consider tokenization to be a straightforward task, but this is not the case with designing a [[multilingual]] indexer.  In digital form, the texts of other languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] represent a greater challenge, as words are not clearly delineated by [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]]. The goal during tokenization is to identify words for which users will search. Language-specific logic is employed to properly identify the boundaries of words, which is often the rationale for designing a parser for each language supported (or for groups of languages with similar boundary markers and syntax).\n\n; Language Ambiguity : To assist with properly ranking matching documents, many search engines collect additional information about each word, such as its [[language]] or [[lexical category]] ([[part of speech]]). These techniques are language-dependent, as the syntax varies among languages. Documents do not always clearly identify the language of the document or represent it accurately. In tokenizing the document, some search engines attempt to automatically identify the language of the document.\n\n; Diverse File Formats : In order to correctly identify which bytes of a document represent characters, the file format must be correctly handled. Search engines which support multiple file formats must be able to correctly open and access the document and be able to tokenize the characters of the document.\n\n; Faulty Storage : The quality of the natural language data may not always be perfect.  An unspecified number of documents, particular on the Internet, do not closely obey proper file protocol.  [[Binary data|Binary]] characters may be mistakenly encoded into various parts of a document. Without recognition of these characters and appropriate handling, the index quality or indexer performance could degrade.\n\n=== Tokenization ===\nUnlike [[literacy|literate]] humans, computers do not understand the structure of a natural language document and cannot automatically recognize words and sentences. To a computer, a document is only a sequence of bytes. Computers do not \'know\' that a space character separates words in a document. Instead, humans must program the computer to identify what constitutes an individual or distinct word, referred to as a token. Such a program is commonly called a [[tokenizer]] or [[parser]] or [[Lexical analysis|lexer]]. Many search engines, as well as other natural language processing software, incorporate [[Comparison of parser generators|specialized programs]] for parsing, such as [[YACC]] or [[Lex programming tool|Lex]].\n\nDuring tokenization, the parser identifies sequences of characters which represent words and other elements, such as punctuation, which are represented by numeric codes, some of which are non-printing control characters. The parser can also identify [[Entity extraction|entities]] such as [[email]] addresses, phone numbers, and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s. When identifying each token, several characteristics may be stored, such as the token\'s case (upper, lower, mixed, proper), language or encoding, lexical category (part of speech, like \'noun\' or \'verb\'), position, sentence number, sentence position, length, and line number.\n\n=== Language recognition ===\nIf the search engine supports multiple languages, a common initial step during tokenization is to identify each document\'s language; many of the subsequent steps are language dependent (such as [[stemming]] and [[part of speech]] tagging). [[Language identification|Language recognition]] is the process by which a computer program attempts to automatically identify, or categorize, the [[language]] of a document. Other names for language recognition include language classification, language analysis, language identification, and language tagging. Automated language recognition is the subject of ongoing research in [[natural language processing]]. Finding which language the words belongs to may involve the use of a [[language recognition chart]].\n\n=== Format analysis ===\nIf the search engine supports multiple [[File format|document formats]], documents must be prepared for tokenization. The challenge is that many document formats contain formatting information in addition to textual content.  For example, [[HTML]] documents contain HTML tags, which specify formatting information such as new line starts, \'\'\'bold\'\'\' emphasis, and [[font]] size or [[Font family|style]].  If the search engine were to ignore the difference between content and \'markup\', extraneous information would be included in the index, leading to poor search results. Format analysis is the identification and handling of the formatting content embedded within documents which controls the way the document is rendered on a computer screen or interpreted by a software program. Format analysis is also referred to as structure analysis, format parsing, tag stripping, format stripping, text normalization, text cleaning, and text preparation. The challenge of format analysis is further complicated by the intricacies of various file formats. Certain file formats are proprietary with very little information disclosed, while others are well documented. Common, well-documented file formats that many search engines support include:\n\n* [[HTML]]\n* [[ASCII]] text files (a text document without specific computer readable formatting)\n* [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]\'s Portable Document Format ([[PDF]])\n* [[PostScript]] (PS)\n* [[LaTeX]]\n* [[UseNet]] netnews server formats\n* [[XML]] and derivatives like [[RSS]]\n* [[SGML]]\n* [[Multimedia]] [[meta data]] formats like [[ID3]]\n* [[Microsoft Word]]\n* [[Microsoft Excel]]\n* [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]\n* IBM [[Lotus Notes]]\nOptions for dealing with various formats include using a publicly available commercial parsing tool that is offered by the organization which developed, maintains, or owns the format, and writing a custom [[parser]].\n\nSome search engines support inspection of files that are stored in a [[Compressor (software)|compressed]] or encrypted file format.  When working with a compressed format, the indexer first decompresses the document; this step may result in one or more files, each of which must be indexed separately. Commonly supported [[list of archive formats|compressed file format]]s include:\n\n* [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] - Zip archive file\n* [[RAR]] - Roshal ARchive file\n* [[Cabinet (file format)|CAB]] - [[Microsoft Windows]] Cabinet File\n* [[Gzip]] - File compressed with gzip\n* [[Bzip2|BZIP]] - File compressed using bzip2\n* [[Tar (file format)|Tape ARchive (TAR)]], [[Unix]] archive file, not (itself) compressed\n* TAR.Z, TAR.GZ or TAR.BZ2 - [[Unix]] archive files compressed with Compress, GZIP or BZIP2\n\nFormat analysis can involve quality improvement methods to avoid including \'bad information\' in the index.  Content can manipulate the formatting information to include additional content. Examples of abusing document formatting for [[spamdexing]]:\n\n* Including hundreds or thousands of words in a section which is hidden from view on the computer screen, but visible to the indexer, by use of formatting (e.g. hidden [[Span and div|"div" tag]] in [[HTML]], which may incorporate the use of [[CSS]] or [[JavaScript]] to do so).\n* Setting the foreground font color of words to the same as the background color, making words hidden on the computer screen to a person viewing the document, but not hidden to the indexer.\n\n=== Section recognition ===\nSome search engines incorporate section recognition, the identification of major parts of a document, prior to tokenization. Not all the documents in a corpus read like a well-written book, divided into organized chapters and pages.  Many documents on the [[Internet|web]], such as newsletters and corporate reports, contain erroneous content and side-sections which do not contain primary material (that which the document is about). For example, this article displays a side menu with links to other web pages. Some file formats, like HTML or PDF, allow for content to be displayed in columns. Even though the content is displayed, or rendered, in different areas of the view, the raw markup content may store this information sequentially. Words that appear sequentially in the raw source content are indexed sequentially, even though these sentences and paragraphs are rendered in different parts of the computer screen. If search engines index this content as if it were normal content, the quality of the index and search quality may be degraded due to the mixed content and improper word proximity. Two primary problems are noted:\n\n* Content in different sections is treated as related in the index, when in reality it is not\n* Organizational \'side bar\' content is included in the index, but the side bar content does not contribute to the meaning of the document, and the index is filled with a poor representation of its documents.\n\nSection analysis may require the search engine to implement the rendering logic of each document, essentially an abstract representation of the actual document, and then index the representation instead. For example, some content on the Internet is rendered via JavaScript. If the search engine does not render the page and evaluate the JavaScript within the page, it would not \'see\' this content in the same way and would index the document incorrectly. Given that some search engines do not bother with rendering issues, many web page designers avoid displaying content via JavaScript or use the [[Noscript tag]] to ensure that the web page is indexed properly.  At the same time, this fact can also be [[spamdexing|exploited]] to cause the search engine indexer to \'see\' different content than the viewer.\n\n=== HTML Priority System ===\n{{Section OR|date=November 2013}}\nIndexing often has to recognize the [[HTML]] tags to organize priority. Indexing low priority to high margin to labels like \'\'strong\'\' and \'\'link\'\' to optimize the order of priority if those labels are at the beginning of the text could not prove to be relevant. Some indexers like [[Google]] and [[Bing]] ensure that the [[search engine]] does not take the large texts as relevant source due to[[ strong type system]] compatibility.<ref>Google Webmaster Tools, "Hypertext Markup Language 5", Conference for SEO January 2012.</ref>\n\n=== Meta tag indexing ===\nSpecific documents often contain embedded meta information such as author, keywords, description, and language. For HTML pages, the [[meta tag]] contains keywords which are also included in the index. Earlier Internet [[search engine technology]] would only index the keywords in the meta tags for the forward index; the full document would not be parsed. At that time full-text indexing was not as well established, nor was [[computer hardware]] able to support such technology.  The design of the HTML markup language initially included support for meta tags for the very purpose of being properly and easily indexed, without requiring tokenization.<ref>Berners-Lee, T., "Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0", RFC 1866, Network Working Group, November 1995.</ref>\n\nAs the Internet grew through the 1990s, many [[brick and mortar business|brick-and-mortar corporations]] went \'online\' and established corporate websites. The keywords used to describe webpages (many of which were corporate-oriented webpages similar to product brochures) changed from descriptive to marketing-oriented keywords designed to drive sales by placing the webpage high in the search results for specific search queries. The fact that these keywords were subjectively specified was leading to [[spamdexing]], which drove many search engines to adopt full-text indexing technologies in the 1990s. Search engine designers and companies could only place so many \'marketing keywords\' into the content of a webpage before draining it of all interesting and useful information.  Given that conflict of interest with the business goal of designing user-oriented websites which were \'sticky\', the [[customer lifetime value]] equation was changed to incorporate more useful content into the website in hopes of retaining the visitor. In this sense, full-text indexing was more objective and increased the quality of search engine results, as it was one more step away from subjective control of search engine result placement, which in turn furthered research of full-text indexing technologies.\n\nIn [[Desktop search]], many solutions incorporate meta tags to provide a way for authors to further customize how the search engine will index content from various files that is not evident from the file content. Desktop search is more under the control of the user, while Internet search engines must focus more on the full text index.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Compound term processing]]\n* [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]]\n* [[Content analysis]]\n* [[Controlled vocabulary]]\n* [[Desktop search]]\n* [[Documentation]]\n* [[Document retrieval|Document Retrieval]]\n* [[Full text search]]\n* [[Index (database)]]\n* [[Information extraction]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[Key Word in Context|Keyword In Context Indexing]]\n* [[Latent semantic indexing]]\n* [[List of search engines]]\n* [[Natural language processing]]\n* [[Search engine]]\n* [[Selection-based search]]\n* [[Semantic Web]]\n* [[Site map]]\n* [[Text mining]]\n* [[Text retrieval|Text Retrieval]]\n* [[Vertical search]]\n* [[Web crawler]]\n* [[Web indexing]]\n* [[Website Parse Template]]\n*[[Windows indexing service]]<ref>Krishna Nareddy.

So the type-1 OWA operators provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.\n\nFirst, there are two definitions for type-1 OWA operators, one is based on Zadeh\'s Extension Principle, the other is based on <math>\\alpha</math>-cuts of fuzzy sets. The two definitions lead to equivalent results.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n\'\'\'Definition 1.<ref name="fssT1OWA" /> \'\'\'\nLet <math>F(X)</math> be the set of fuzzy sets with domain of discourse <math>X</math>, a type-1 OWA operator is defined as follows:\n\nGiven n linguistic weights <math>\\left\\{ {W^i} \\right\\}_{i = 1}^n </math> in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse <math>U = [0,1]</math>, a type-1 OWA operator is a mapping, <math>\\Phi</math>,\n\n:<math>\\Phi \\colon F(X)\\times \\cdots \\times F(X)  \\longrightarrow  F(X)</math>\n:<math>(A^1 , \\cdots ,A^n)  \\mapsto   Y</math>\n\nsuch that\n\n:<math>\\mu _{Y} (y) =\\displaystyle \\sup_{\\displaystyle \\sum_{k =1}^n \\bar {w}_i a_{\\sigma (i)}  = y }\\left({\\begin{array}{*{1}l}\\mu _{W^1 } (w_1 )\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\mu_{W^n } (w_n )\\wedge \\mu _{A^1 } (a_1 )\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\mu _{A^n } (a_n )\\end{array}}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar {w}_i = \\frac{w_i }{\\sum_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }</math>,and <math>\\sigma \\colon \\{1, \\cdots ,n\\} \\longrightarrow \\{1, \\cdots ,n\\}</math> is a permutation function such that <math>a_{\\sigma (i)} \\geq a_{\\sigma (i + 1)},\\ \\forall i = 1, \\cdots ,n - 1</math>, i.e., <math>a_{\\sigma(i)} </math> is the <math>i</math>th highest element in the set <math>\\left\\{ {a_1 , \\cdots ,a_n } \\right\\}</math>.\n\n\'\'\'Definition 2.<ref name="kdeT1OWA" /> \'\'\'\n\nThe definition below is based on the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets:\n\nGiven the n linguistic weights <math>\\left\\{ {W^i} \\right\\}_{i =1}^n </math> in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse <math>U = [0,\\;\\;1]</math>, then for each <math>\\alpha \\in [0,\\;1]</math>, an <math>\\alpha </math>-level type-1 OWA operator with <math>\\alpha </math>-level sets <math>\\left\\{ {W_\\alpha ^i } \\right\\}_{i = 1}^n </math> to aggregate the <math>\\alpha </math>-cuts of fuzzy sets <math>\\left\\{ {A^i} \\right\\}_{i =1}^n </math> is given as\n\n: <math>\n\\Phi_\\alpha \\left( {A_\\alpha ^1 , \\ldots ,A_\\alpha ^n } \\right) =\\left\\{ {\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\\sigma (i)} } }{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\\left| {w_i \\in W_\\alpha ^i ,\\;a_i } \\right. \\in A_\\alpha ^i ,\\;i = 1, \\ldots ,n} \\right\\}</math>\n\nwhere  <math>W_\\alpha ^i= \\{w| \\mu_{W_i }(w) \\geq \\alpha \\}, A_\\alpha ^i=\\{ x| \\mu _{A_i }(x)\\geq \\alpha \\}</math>, and <math>\\sigma :\\{\\;1, \\cdots ,n\\;\\} \\to \\{\\;1, \\cdots ,n\\;\\}</math> is a permutation function such that <math>a_{\\sigma (i)} \\ge a_{\\sigma (i + 1)} ,\\;\\forall \\;i = 1, \\cdots ,n - 1</math>, i.e., <math>a_{\\sigma (i)} </math> is the <math>i</math>th largest\nelement in the set <math>\\left\\{ {a_1 , \\cdots ,a_n } \\right\\}</math>.\n\n== Representation theorem of Type-1 OWA operators<ref name="kdeT1OWA" />==\n\nGiven the \'\'n\'\' linguistic weights <math>\\left\\{ {W^i} \\right\\}_{i =1}^n </math> in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse <math>U = [0,\\;\\;1]</math>, and the fuzzy sets <math>A^1, \\cdots ,A^n</math>, then we have that<ref name="kdeT1OWA" />\n:<math>Y=G</math>\n\nwhere <math>Y</math> is the aggregation result obtained by Definition 1, and <math>G</math> is the result obtained by in Definition 2.\n\n==Programming problems for Type-1 OWA operators==\n\nAccording to the \'\'\'\'\'Representation Theorem of Type-1 OWA Operators\'\'\'\'\',a general type-1 OWA operator can be decomposed into a series of <math>\\alpha</math>-level type-1 OWA operators. In practice, these series of  <math>\\alpha</math>-level type-1 OWA operators are used to construct the resulting aggregation fuzzy set. So we only need to compute the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals <math>\\Phi _\\alpha \\left( {A_\\alpha ^1 , \\cdots ,A_\\alpha ^n } \\right)</math>. Then, the resulting aggregation fuzzy set is constructed with the membership function as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mu _{G} (x) = \\mathop \\vee \\limits_{\\alpha :x \\in \\Phi _\\alpha \\left( {A_\\alpha ^1 , \\cdots\n,A_\\alpha ^n } \\right)_\\alpha } \\alpha </math>\n\nFor the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:\n:<math> \\Phi _\\alpha \\left( {A_\\alpha ^1 , \\cdots ,A_\\alpha ^n } \\right)_{-} = \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{\\begin{array}{l} W_{\\alpha - }^i \\le w_i \\le W_{\\alpha + }^i A_{\\alpha - }^i \\le a_i \\le A_{\\alpha + }^i  \\end{array}} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\\sigma (i)} / \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } </math>\n\nwhile for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:\n:<math>\\Phi _\\alpha \\left( {A_\\alpha ^1 , \\cdots , A_\\alpha ^n } \\right)_{+} = \\mathop {\\max }\\limits_{\\begin{array}{l} W_{\\alpha - }^i \\le w_i \\le W_{\\alpha + }^i  A_{\\alpha - }^i \\le a_i \\le A_{\\alpha + }^i  \\end{array}} \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\\sigma (i)} / \\sum\\limits_{i =\n1}^n {w_i } } </math>\n\nA fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.<ref name="kdeT1OWA" />\n\n== Alpha-level approach to Type-1 OWA operation<ref name="kdeT1OWA" />==\n* \'\'\'Step 1\'\'\'.To set up the <math>\\alpha </math>- level resolution in [0, 1].\n* \'\'\'Step 2\'\'\'.
