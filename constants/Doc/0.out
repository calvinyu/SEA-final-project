S'\'\'\'Preference learning\'\'\' is a subfield in [[machine learning]] in which the goal is to learn a predictive [[Preference (economics)|preference]] model from observed preference information.<ref>[[Mehryar Mohri]], Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar (2012) \'\'Foundations of Machine Learning\'\', The\nMIT Press ISBN 9780262018258.</ref> In the view of [[supervised learning]], preference learning trains on a set of items which have preferences toward labels or other items and predicts the preferences for all items.\n\nWhile the concept of preference learning has been emerged for some time in many fields such as [[economics]],<ref name="SHOG00" /> it\'s a relatively new topic in [[Artificial Intelligence]] research. Several workshops have been discussing preference learning and related topics in the past decade.<ref name="WEB:WORKSHOP" />\n\n==Tasks==\n\nThe main task in preference learning concerns problems in "[[learning to rank]]". According to different types of preference information observed, the tasks are categorized as three main problems in the book \'\'Preference Learning\'\':<ref name="FURN11" />\n\n===Label ranking===\n\nIn label ranking, the model has an instance space <math>X=\\{x_i\\}\\,\\!</math> and a finite set of labels <math>Y=\\{y_i|i=1,2,\\cdots,k\\}\\,\\!</math>. The preference information is given in the form <math>y_i \\succ_{x} y_j\\,\\!</math> indicating instance <math>x\\,\\!</math> shows preference in <math>y_i\\,\\!</math> rather than <math>y_j\\,\\!</math>. A set of preference information is used as training data in the model. The task of this model is to find a preference ranking among the labels for any instance.\n\nIt was observed some conventional [[Classification in machine learning|classification]] problems can be generalized in the framework of label ranking problem:<ref name="HARP03" /> if a training instance <math>x\\,\\!</math> is labeled as class <math>y_i\\,\\!</math>, it implies that <math>\\forall j \\neq i, y_i \\succ_{x} y_j\\,\\!</math>. In [[Multi-label classification|multi-label]] situation, <math>x\\,\\!</math> is associated with a set of labels <math>L \\subseteq Y\\,\\!</math> and thus the model can extract a set of preference information <math>\\{y_i \\succ_{x} y_j | y_i \\in L, y_j \\in Y\\backslash L\\}\\,\\!</math>. Training a preference model on this preference information and the classification result of an instance is just the corresponding top ranking label.\n\n===Instance ranking===\n\nInstance ranking also has the instance space <math>X\\,\\!</math> and label set <math>Y\\,\\!</math>. In this task, labels are defined to have a fixed order <math>y_1 \\succ y_2 \\succ \\cdots \\succ y_k\\,\\!</math> and each instance <math>x_l\\,\\!</math> is associated with a label <math>y_l\\,\\!</math>. Giving a set of instances as training data, the goal of this task is to find the ranking order for a new set of instances.\n\n===Object ranking===\n\nObject ranking is similar to instance ranking except that no labels are associated with instances. Given a set of pairwise preference information in the form <math>x_i \\succ x_j\\,\\!</math> and the model should find out a ranking order among instances.\n\n==Techniques==\n\nThere are two practical representations of the preference information <math>A \\succ B\\,\\!</math>. One is assigning <math>A\\,\\!</math> and <math>B\\,\\!</math> with two real numbers <math>a\\,\\!</math> and <math>b\\,\\!</math> respectively such that <math>a > b\\,\\!</math>. Another one is assigning a binary value <math>V(A,B) \\in \\{0,1\\}\\,\\!</math> for all pairs <math>(A,B)\\,\\!</math> denoting whether <math>A \\succ B\\,\\!</math> or <math>B \\succ A\\,\\!</math>. Corresponding to these two different representations, there are two different techniques applied to the learning process.\n\n===Utility function===\n\nIf we can find a mapping from data to real numbers, ranking the data can be solved by ranking the real numbers. This mapping is called [[utility function]]. For label ranking the mapping is a function <math>f: X \\times Y \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\,\\!</math> such that <math>y_i \\succ_x y_j \\Rightarrow f(x,y_i) > f(x,y_j)\\,\\!</math>. For instance ranking and object ranking, the mapping is a function <math>f: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\,\\!</math>.\n\nFinding the utility function is a [[Regression analysis|regression]] learning problem which is well developed in machine learning.\n\n===Preference relations===\n\nThe binary representation of preference information is called preference relation. For each pair of alternatives (instances or labels), a binary predicate can be learned by conventional supervising learning approach. F\xc3\xbcrnkranz, Johannes and H\xc3\xbcllermeier proposed this approach in label ranking problem.<ref name="FURN03" /> For object ranking, there is an early approach by Cohen et al.<ref name="COHE98" />\n\nUsing preference relations to predict the ranking will not be so intuitive. Since preference relation is not transitive, it implies that the solution of ranking satisfying those relations would sometimes be unreachable, or there could be more than one solution. A more common approach is to find a ranking solution which is maximally consistent with the preference relations. This approach is a natural extension of pairwise classification.<ref name="FURN03" />\n\n==Uses==\n\nPreference learning can be used in ranking search results according to feedback of user preference. Given a query and a set of documents, a learning model is used to find the ranking of documents corresponding to the relevance with this query. More discussions on research in this field can be found in Tie-Yan Liu\'s survey paper.<ref name="LIU09" />\n\nAnother application of preference learning is [[recommender systems]].<ref name="GEMM09" /> Online store may analyze customer\'s purchase record to learn a preference model and then recommend similar products to customers. Internet content providers can make use of user\'s ratings to provide more user preferred contents.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Learning to rank]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|\nrefs=\n\n<ref name="SHOG00">{{\ncite journal\n|last       = Shogren\n|first      = Jason F.\n|coauthors  = List, John A.; Hayes, Dermot J.\n|year       = 2000\n|title      = Preference Learning in Consecutive Experimental Auctions\n|url        = http://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupajagec/v_3a82_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1016-1021.htm\n|journal    = American Journal of Agricultural Economics\n|volume     = 82\n|pages      = 1016\xe2\x80\x931021\n|doi=10.1111/0002-9092.00099\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="WEB:WORKSHOP">{{\ncite web\n|title      = Preference learning workshops\n|url        = http://www.preference-learning.org/#Workshops\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="FURN11">{{\ncite book\n|last       = F&uuml;rnkranz\n|first      = Johannes\n|coauthors  = H&uuml;llermeier, Eyke\n|year       = 2011\n|title      = Preference Learning\n|url        = http://books.google.com/books?id=nc3XcH9XSgYC\n|chapter    = Preference Learning: An Introduction\n|chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=nc3XcH9XSgYC&pg=PA4\n|publisher  = Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.\n|pages      = 3\xe2\x80\x938\n|isbn       = 978-3-642-14124-9\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="HARP03">{{\ncite journal\n|last       = Har-peled\n|first      = Sariel\n|coauthors  = Roth, Dan; Zimak, Dav\n|year       = 2003\n|title      = Constraint classification for multiclass classification and ranking\n|journal    = In Proceedings of the 16th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS-02\n|pages      = 785\xe2\x80\x93792\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="FURN03">{{\ncite journal\n|last       = F&uuml;rnkranz\n|first      = Johannes\n|coauthors  = H&uuml;llermeier, Eyke\n|year       = 2003\n|title      = Pairwise Preference Learning and Ranking\n|journal    = Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Machine Learning\n|pages      = 145\xe2\x80\x93156\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="COHE98">{{\ncite journal\n|last       = Cohen\n|first      = William W.\n|coauthors  = Schapire, Robert E.; Singer, Yoram\n|year       = 1998\n|title      = Learning to order things\n|url        = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=302528.302736\n|journal    = In Proceedings of the 1997 Conference on Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems\n|pages      = 451\xe2\x80\x93457\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="LIU09">{{\ncite journal\n|last       = Liu\n|first      = Tie-Yan\n|year       = 2009\n|title      = Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval\n|url        = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1618303.1618304\n|journal    = Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval\n|volume     = 3\n|issue      = 3\n|pages      = 225\xe2\x80\x93331\n|doi        = 10.1561/1500000016\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="GEMM09">{{\ncite journal\n|last       = Gemmis\n|first      = Marco De\n|author2=Iaquinta, Leo |author3=Lops, Pasquale |author4=Musto, Cataldo |author5=Narducci, Fedelucio |author6= Semeraro,Giovanni \n|year       = 2009\n|title      = Preference Learning in Recommender Systems\n|url        = http://www.ecmlpkdd2009.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/preference-learning.pdf#page=45\n|journal    = PREFERENCE LEARNING\n|volume     = 41\n|pages      = 387\xe2\x80\x93407\n|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-14125-6_18\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.preference-learning.org/ Preference Learning site]\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Machine learning]]'

S'In research communities (for example, [[earth science]]s), \'\'\'subsetting\'\'\' is the process of retrieving just the parts of large files which are of interest for a specific purpose. This occurs usually in a client\xe2\x80\x94server setting, where the extraction of the parts of interest occurs on the server before the data is sent to the client over a network.

They send collected data back to the indexing software which categorizes and adds the links to databases with their related keywords. When you specify a search term the engine does not scan the whole web but extracts related links from the database.\n\n==History of Search Technology==\n\n{{Empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n== The Memex ==\n\nThe concept of hypertext and a memory extension originates from an article that was published in [[The Atlantic Monthly]] in July 1945 written by [[Vannevar Bush]], titled [[As We May Think]].  Within this article Vannevar urged scientists to work together to help build a body of knowledge for all mankind. He then proposed the idea of a virtually limitless, fast, reliable, extensible, associative memory storage and retrieval system. He named this device a [[memex]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yeo|first1=Richard|title=Before Memex: Robert Hooke, John Locke, and Vannevar Bush on External Memory|journal=Science in Context|date=30 January 2007|volume=20|issue=01|page=21|doi=10.1017/S0269889706001128}}</ref>\n\nBush regarded the notion of \xe2\x80\x9cassociative indexing\xe2\x80\x9d as his key conceptual contri- bution. As he explained, this was \xe2\x80\x9ca provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.\xe2\x80\x9d This \xe2\x80\x9clinking\xe2\x80\x9d (as we now say) constituted a \xe2\x80\x9ctrail\xe2\x80\x9d of documents that could be named, coded, and found again. Moreover, after the original two items were coupled, \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous items\xe2\x80\x9d could be \xe2\x80\x9cjoined together to form a trail\xe2\x80\x9d; they could be \xe2\x80\x9creviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>{{cite journal|title=Before Memex: Robert Hooke, John Locke, and Vannevar Bush on External Memory|journal=Science in Context|date=30 January 2007|volume=20|issue=01|pages=21\xe2\x80\x9347|doi=10.1017/S0269889706001128|accessdate=1 June 2014|postscript=The example Bush gives is a quest to find information on the relative merits of the Turkish short bow and the English long bow in the crusades}}</ref>\n\nAll of the documents used in the memex would be in the form of microfilm copy acquired as such or, in the case of personal records, transformed to microfilm by the machine itself. Memex would also employ new retrieval techniques based on a new kind of associative indexing the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another to create personal "trails" through linked documents. The new procedures, that Bush anticipated facilitating information storage and retrieval would lead to the development of wholly new forms of encyclopedia.\n\nThe most important mechanism, conceived by Bush and considered as closed to the modern hypertext systems is the associative trail. It would be a way to create a new linear sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and side trails.\nThe essential feature of the memex [is] the process of tying two items together\xe2\x80\xa6 When the user is building a trail, he names it in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined\xe2\x80\xa6 Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.\n\nIn the article of Bush is not described any automatic search, nor any universal metadata scheme such as a standard library classification or a hypertext element set. Instead, when the user made an entry, such as a new or annotated manuscript, or image, he was expected to index and describe it in his personal code book. Later on, by consulting his code book, the user could retrace annotated and generated entries.\n\nIn 1965 Bush took part in the project INTREX of MIT, for developing technology for mechanization the processing of information for library use. In his 1967 essay titled "Memex Revisited", he pointed out that the development of the digital computer, the transistor, the video, and other similar devices had heightened the feasibility of such mechanization, but costs would delay its achievements. He was right again.\n\nTed Nelson, who later did pioneering work with first practical hypertext system and coined the term "hypertext" in the 1960s, credited Bush as his main influence.<ref>{{cite web|title=The MEMEX of Vannevar Bush|url=http://history-computer.com/Internet/Dreamers/Bush.html}}</ref>\n\n== SMART ==\n\nGerard Salton, who died on August 28 of 1995, was the father of modern search technology. His teams at Harvard and Cornell developed the SMART informational retrieval system. Salton\xe2\x80\x99s Magic Automatic Retriever of Text included important concepts like the vector space model, Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), Term Frequency (TF), term discrimination values, and relevancy feedback mechanisms.\n\nHe authored a 56 page book called A Theory of Indexing which explained many of his tests upon which search is still largely based.\n\n== String Search Engines ==\n\nIn 1987 an article was published detailing the development of a character string search engine (SSE) for rapid text retrieval on a double-metal 1.6-\xce\xbcm n-well CMOS solid-state circuit with 217,600 transistors lain out on a 8.62x12.76-mm die area. The SSE accommodated a novel string-search architecture which combines a 512-stage finite-state automaton (FSA) logic with a content addressable memory (CAM) to achieve an approximate string comparison of 80 million strings per second. The CAM cell consisted of four conventional static RAM (SRAM) cells and a read/write circuit. Concurrent comparison of 64 stored strings with variable length was achieved in 50 ns for an input text stream of 10 million characters/s, permitting performance despite the presence of single character errors in the form of character codes. Furthermore, the chip allowed nonanchor string search and variable-length `don\'t care\' (VLDC) string search.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yamada|first=H.|author2=Hirata, M. |author3=Nagai, H. |author4= Takahashi, K. |title=A high-speed string-search engine|journal=IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits|date=Oct 1987|volume=22|issue=5|pages=829\xe2\x80\x93834|doi=10.1109/JSSC.1987.1052819|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1052819&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D1052819|accessdate=30 May 2014|publisher=IEEE}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Potential source for article expansion:  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText%3Dsearch-engine&sortType=asc_p_Publication_Year&pageNumber=1&resultAction=SORT -->\n\n== Web Search Engines ==\n\n=== Archie ===\n\nThe first web search engines was Archie, created in 1990<ref name="intelligent-technologies">{{cite book|author1=Priti Srinivas Sajja|author2=Rajendra Akerkar|title=Intelligent technologies for web applications|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4398-7162-1|page=87|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HqXxoWK7tucC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=the+University+of+Nevada+System+Computing+Services+group+developed+Veronica.&source=bl&ots=Xt7TQz0a6Y&sig=vusKa34uORNCBI6lT3-sEy5qv-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KzqOU7PCDcOlyATtt4L4DA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=the%20University%20of%20Nevada%20System%20Computing%20Services%20group%20developed%20Veronica.&f=false|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> by Alan Emtage, a student at McGill University in Montreal. The author originally wanted to call the program "archives," but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short, cryptic names such as grep, cat, troff, sed, awk, perl, and so on. For more information on where Archie is today, see:\nhttp://www.bunyip.com/products/archie/\n\nThe primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This was (and still is) a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet. It works like this: Some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer. He sets up a program on his computer, called an FTP server. When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer, he or she connects to it via another program called an FTP client. Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol.\n\nInitially, anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others. Later, "anonymous" FTP sites became repositories for files, allowing all users to post and retrieve them.\n\nEven with archive sites, many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers. Unfortunately, these files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth: Somebody would post an e-mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file.\n\nArchie changed all that. It combined a script-based data gatherer, which fetched site listings of anonymous FTP files, with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query. (4) In other words, Archie\'s gatherer scoured FTP sites across the Internet and indexed all of the files it found. Its regular expression matcher provided users with access to its database.<ref name="wileyhistory">{{cite web|title=A History of Search Engines|url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/compbooks/sonnenreich/history.html|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Veronica ===\n\nIn 1993, the University of Nevada System Computing Services group developed Veronica.<ref name="intelligent-technologies"/> It was created as a type of searching device similar to Archie but for Gopher files. Another Gopher search service, called Jughead, appeared a little later, probably for the sole purpose of rounding out the comic-strip triumvirate. Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy\'s Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display, although, like Veronica, it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym. Jughead\'s functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica\'s, although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges.<ref name="wileyhistory"/>\n\n=== The Lone Wanderer ===\n\nThe World Wide Web Wanderer, developed by Matthew Gray in 1993<ref>{{cite book|author1=Priti Srinivas Sajja|author2=Rajendra Akerkar|title=Intelligent technologies for web applications|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4398-7162-1|page=86|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HqXxoWK7tucC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=the+University+of+Nevada+System+Computing+Services+group+developed+Veronica.&source=bl&ots=Xt7TQz0a6Y&sig=vusKa34uORNCBI6lT3-sEy5qv-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KzqOU7PCDcOlyATtt4L4DA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=the%20University%20of%20Nevada%20System%20Computing%20Services%20group%20developed%20Veronica.&f=false|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> was the first robot on the Web and was designed to track the Web\'s growth. Initially, the Wanderer counted only Web servers, but shortly after its introduction, it started to capture URLs as it went along. The database of captured URLs became the Wandex, the first web database.\n\nMatthew Gray\'s Wanderer created quite a controversy at the time, partially because early versions of the software ran rampant through the Net and caused a noticeable netwide performance degradation. This degradation occurred because the Wanderer would access the same page hundreds of time a day. The Wanderer soon amended its ways, but the controversy over whether robots were good or bad for the Internet remained.\n\nIn response to the Wanderer, Martijn Koster created Archie-Like Indexing of the Web, or ALIWEB, in October 1993. As the name implies, ALIWEB was the HTTP equivalent of Archie, and because of this, it is still unique in many ways.\n\nALIWEB does not have a web-searching robot. Instead, webmasters of participating sites post their own index information for each page they want listed. The advantage to this method is that users get to describe their own site, and a robot doesn\'t run about eating up Net bandwidth.  Unfortunately, the disadvantages of ALIWEB are more of a problem today. The primary disadvantage is that a special indexing file must be submitted. Most users do not understand how to create such a file, and therefore they don\'t submit their pages. This leads to a relatively small database, which meant that users are less likely to search ALIWEB than one of the large bot-based sites. This Catch-22 has been somewhat offset by incorporating other databases into the ALIWEB search, but it still does not have the mass appeal of search engines such as Yahoo! or Lycos.<ref name="wileyhistory"/>\n\n=== Excite ===\n\nExcite, initially called Architext, was started by six Stanford undergraduates in February 1993. Their idea was to use statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches through the large amount of information on the Internet.\nTheir project was fully funded by mid-1993. Once funding was secured. they released a version of their search software for webmasters to use on their own web sites. At the time, the software was called Architext, but it now goes by the name of Excite for Web Servers.<ref name="wileyhistory"/>\n\nExcite was the first serious commercial search engine which launched in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major Search Engines|url=http://www.pccua.edu/kholland/major_search_engines.htm|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=21 January 2014}}</ref> It was developed in Stanford and was purchased for $6.5 billion by @Home. In 2001 Excite and @Home went bankrupt and InfoSpace bought Excite for $10 million.\n\n=== Yahoo! ===\n\nIn April 1994, two Stanford University Ph.D. candidates, David Filo and Jerry Yang, created some pages that became rather popular. They called the collection of pages Yahoo! Their official explanation for the name choice was that they considered themselves to be a pair of yahoos.\n\nAs the number of links grew and their pages began to receive thousands of hits a day, the team created ways to better organize the data. In order to aid in data retrieval, Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) became a searchable directory. The search feature was a simple database search engine. Because Yahoo! entries were entered and categorized manually, Yahoo! was not really classified as a search engine. Instead, it was generally considered to be a searchable directory. Yahoo! has since automated some aspects of the gathering and classification process, blurring the distinction between engine and directory.\n\nThe Wanderer captured only URLs, which made it difficult to find things that weren\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly described by their URL. Because URLs are rather cryptic to begin with, this didn\xe2\x80\x99t help the average user. Searching Yahoo! or the Galaxy was much more effective because they contained additional descriptive information about the indexed sites.\n\n=== Lycos ===\n\nAt Carnegie Mellon University during the July of 1994, Michael Mauldin, on leave from CMU,developed the Lycos search engine.\n\n== Types of Web Search Engines ==\n\nSearch engines on the web are sites enriched with facility to search the content stored on other sites.

The crawler returns all that information back to a central depository, where the data is indexed. The crawler will periodically return to the sites to check for any information that has changed. The frequency with which this happens is determined by the administrators of the search engine.\n\nHuman-powered search engines rely on humans to submit information that is subsequently indexed and catalogued. Only information that is submitted is put into the index.\n\nIn both cases, when you query a search engine to locate information, you\'re actually searching through the index that the search engine has created \xe2\x80\x94you are not actually searching the Web. These indices are giant databases of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched. This explains why sometimes a search on a commercial search engine, such as Yahoo! or Google, will return results that are, in fact, dead links. Since the search results are based on the index, if the index hasn\'t been updated since a Web page became invalid the search engine treats the page as still an active link even though it no longer is. It will remain that way until the index is updated.\n\nSo why will the same search on different search engines produce different results? Part of the answer to that question is because not all indices are going to be exactly the same. It depends on what the spiders find or what the humans submitted. But more important, not every search engine uses the same algorithm to search through the indices. The algorithm is what the search engines use to determine the relevance of the information in the index to what the user is searching for.\n\nOne of the elements that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a Web page. Those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant. But search engine technology is becoming sophisticated in its attempt to discourage what is known as keyword stuffing, or spamdexing.\n\nAnother common element that algorithms analyze is the way that pages link to other pages in the Web. By analyzing how pages link to each other, an engine can both determine what a page is about (if the keywords of the linked pages are similar to the keywords on the original page) and whether that page is considered "important" and deserving of a boost in ranking. Just as the technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated to ignore keyword stuffing, it is also becoming more savvy to Web masters who build artificial links into their sites in order to build an artificial ranking.\n\nModern web search engines are highly intricate software systems that employ technology that has evolved over the years. There are a number of sub-categories of search engine software that are separately applicable to specific \'browsing\' needs. These include web search engines (e.g. [[Google]]), database or structured data search engines (e.g. [[Dieselpoint]]), and mixed search engines or enterprise search. The more prevalent search engines, such as Google and [[Yahoo!]], utilize hundreds of thousands computers to process trillions of web pages in order to return fairly well-aimed results. Due to this high volume of queries and text processing, the software is required to run in a highly dispersed environment with a high degree of superfluity.\n\n==Search engine categories==\n\n===Web search engines===\nSearch engines that are expressly designed for searching web pages, documents, and images were developed to facilitate searching through a large, nebulous blob of unstructured resources. They are engineered to follow a multi-stage process: crawling the infinite stockpile of pages and documents to skim the figurative foam from their contents, indexing the foam/buzzwords in a sort of semi-structured form (database or something), and at last, resolving user entries/queries to return mostly relevant results and links to those skimmed documents or pages from the inventory.\n\n====Crawl====\nIn the case of a wholly textual search, the first step in classifying web pages is to find an \xe2\x80\x98index item\xe2\x80\x99 that might relate expressly to the \xe2\x80\x98search term.\xe2\x80\x99 In the past, search engines began with a small list of URLs as a so-called seed list, fetched the content, and parsed the links on those pages for relevant information, which subsequently provided new links. The process was highly cyclical and continued until enough pages were found for the searcher\xe2\x80\x99s use.\nThese days, a continuous crawl method is employed as opposed to an incidental discovery based on a seed list. The crawl method is an extension of aforementioned discovery method. Except there is no seed list, because the system never stops worming.\n\nMost search engines use sophisticated scheduling algorithms to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide\xe2\x80\x9d when to revisit a particular page, to appeal to its relevance. These algorithms range from constant visit-interval with higher priority for more frequently changing pages to adaptive visit-interval based on several criteria such as frequency of chance, popularity, and overall quality of site. The speed of the web server running the page as well as resource constraints like amount of hardware or bandwidth also figure in.\n\n====Link map====\nThe pages that are discovered by web crawls are often distributed and fed into another computer that creates a veritable map of resources uncovered. The bunchy clustermass looks a little like a graph, on which the different pages are represented as small nodes that are connected by  links between the pages. \nThe excess of data is stored in multiple data structures that permit quick access to said data by certain algorithms that compute the popularity score of pages on the web based on how many links point to a certain web page, which is how people can access any number of resources concerned with diagnosing psychosis. Another example would be the accessibility/rank of web pages containing information on Mohamed Morsi versus the very best attractions to visit in Cairo after simply entering \xe2\x80\x98Egypt\xe2\x80\x99 as a search term. One such algorithm, [[PageRank]], proposed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is well known and has attracted a lot of attention because it highlights repeat mundanity of web searches courtesy of students that don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to properly research subjects on Google.\nThe idea of doing link analysis to compute a popularity rank is older than PageRank. Other variants of the same idea are currently in use \xe2\x80\x93 grade schoolers do the same sort of computations in picking kickball teams. But in all seriousness, these ideas can be categorized into three main categories: rank of individual pages and nature of web site content. Search engines often differentiate between internal links and external links, because web masters and mistresses are not strangers to shameless self-promotion. Link map data structures typically store the anchor text embedded in the links as well, because anchor text can often provide a \xe2\x80\x9cvery good quality\xe2\x80\x9d summary of a web page\xe2\x80\x99s content.\n\n===Database Search Engines===\nSearching for text-based content in databases presents a few special challenges from which a number of specialized search engines flourish. Databases can be slow when solving complex queries (with multiple logical or string matching arguments). Databases allow pseudo-logical queries which full-text searches do not use. There is no crawling necessary for a database since the data is already structured. However, it is often necessary to index the data in a more economized form to allow a more expeditious search.\n\n===Mixed Search Engines===\nSometimes, data searched contains both database content and web pages or documents. Search engine technology has developed to respond to both sets of requirements. Most mixed search engines are large Web search engines, like Google. They search both through structured and unstructured data sources. Take for example, the word \xe2\x80\x98ball.\xe2\x80\x99 In its simplest terms, it returns more than 40 variations on Wikipedia alone. Did you mean a ball, as in the social gathering/dance? A soccer ball? The ball of the foot? Pages and documents are crawled and indexed in a separate index. Databases are indexed also from various sources. Search results are then generated for users by querying these multiple indices in parallel and compounding the results according to \xe2\x80\x9crules.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n<!-- \nWorking on article, loosely pasting in snippets of information to use in improving \narticle later, leaving all this in comments while I work on it\n\nLOTS OF WORK TO DO\n\nPotential sections to research into..\n\n== Models of Information Retrieval ==\n=== Boolean Model ===\n=== Vector Model ===\n\n== Document Preprocessing ==\n# Tokenization ===\n# Stemming ===\n# The Porter Algorithm\n# Storing, indexing, and searching text\n#Inverted indexes\n\n== Word Distributions ==\nThe Zipf distribution\nThe Benford distribution\nHeap\'s law.

Text summarization\n\n== Search Engine Parts ==\n\nThere are three main parts to every search engine: Spider, Index, and Web Interface.\n\n=== Spider === \n   \nA spider crawls the web. It follows links and scans web pages. All search engines have periods of deep crawl and quick crawl. During a deep crawl, the spider follows all links it can find and scans web pages in their entirety. During a quick crawl, the spider does not follow all links and may not scan pages in their entirety.\n\nThe job of the spider is to discover new pages and to collect copies of those pages, which are then analyzed in the index.\n\n==== Crawl Rate ====\n\nPages that are considered important get crawled frequently. The crawl rate depends directly on link popularity and domain authority.\n\nIf many links point to a website, it may be an important site, so it makes sense to crawl it more often than a site with fewer links. This is also a money-saving issue. If search engines were to crawl all sites at an equal rate, it would take more time overall and cost more as a result.\n\n=== Index ===\n\nThe index is the place where search engines keep basic copies of web pages and sort search results. When you a do a search, search engines do not search the web; they show results from their index. The number of pages in the index does not represent the entire web, but the number of pages that the spider has discovered, scanned and saved.\n\nThe index is the place where search engineers apply algorithms, and it is the place where rankings are partially determined. Search engineers may choose to apply an algorithm to the entire index, or only to a portion of it.\n\n==== Datacenters and Different Indexes ====\n\nSearch engines have multiple datacenters around the world. When you enter a search term, your query is directed to the closest datacenter.\n\nDifferent datacenters may have slightly different indexes, especially during an update. As a result, search results may differ depending on your location.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Meta Tags ===\n\nMeta tags were designed to help search engines sort web pages. Pages included keywords in meta tags telling search engines about the contents of each page. For a short time meta tags worked and helped search engines serve relevant results, but over time marketers learned they could easily rank by stuffing those tags with keywords.\n\nAs a result, search engine optimization in those days became about cramming "loans, loans, loans, loans, loans" into the meta tag. Search engines got spammed beyond being of any use, and many faced an exodus of users as a result.\n\nYahoo started as web directory in 1994 and outsourced their search until 2004. Google launched in 1996 and did not have a successful business model until 2001. Microsoft did not come on the search engine scene until 2003.\nor more information on search engine history, you may want to investigate Search Engine History, a site entirely devoted to this topic. It also touches on the history of search engine optimization. Additionally, Web Master World has an excellent thread that covers the history of SEO.\n\nWeb Interface\n\nWhen you search using a web interface (like Google.com), in many cases results are already presorted to a certain extent. The degree to which results are presorted depends on the complexity of the algorithm. If the time to apply an algorithm to the index is considerable, then that algorithm is applied in advance. On the other hand, some algorithms are applied at the time when the search query is requested.\n\nSearch queries go through analysis to determine the possible intent behind the query. Google is currently leading in this area.\n\nStop Words\n\n"Stop words" are words that are frequently used in the English language. Those words include a, the, all, also, but, down, full, much etc. They are words that are used by everyone regardless of the topic. Generally, search engines ignore "stop" words and will usually correct your search to exclude them. For example, when you search for "cat and dog" search engines will exclude "and" and only search for "cat" "dog."\n\nGoogle does use stop words to an extent.\n\nKeyword Density\n\nKeyword density is a measure of how often a word appears on the page in relation to other words. It is an over-hyped measurement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help in search rankings. Search engines use far more than keyword density for on-page analysis. Their technology includes the location of terms on the page, word proximity and natural language processing.\n\nGoogle has purchased Applied Semantics for its AdSense Network, but may also be using this technology for on-page analysis. Additionally, please keep in mind that one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s current projects involves scanning thousands of books, from which it may learn more about natural language patterns.\n\nLocation of Terms on The Page\n\nBy analyzing how terms are located in relation to each other on the page, search engines can determine partial relevancy of the page. The closer terms are to each other, the more relevant a page is.\n\nIn many cases, keywords appear separately from each other throughout the page. This is considered normal in most cases, but be sure to include a term together at least once in the title, heading or paragraph.\n\nLink Analysis\n\nLink analysis is at the core of all search engine relevancy. Apart from Page Rank and general link popularity, Google looks at: link anchor text, the page from which the link comes, age of the link, location of the link, title of the page from which the link comes, authority of the linking page and more.\n\nLinks are the biggest quality indicators that search engines have at the moment. Before search engines existed, and before the web was commercialized it was much harder to find information. All you had to rely on was links. There were few if any spammers, and people who found interesting sites shared those sites with others by placing a link. Also, the first web pages and servers were universities and colleges; this is why Google is biased toward .edu domains \xe2\x80\x93 they were the first on the scene, and usually contain quality content and resources.\n\nAs the web became commercial and Google\xe2\x80\x99s Page Rank well known, links became a form of advertising, where a link could be bought or artificially made by spammers. This is the reason for Google\xe2\x80\x99s bias toward older links and links from trusted domains.\n\nYahoo put less weight on link analysis than Google, while Ask.com is more about "authoritative hubs." Ask.com generally has a harder time ranking documents unless there\xe2\x80\x99s a community around a topic.\n\nSize and Length of the Page\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no "best" page copy length for ranking on search results. Search engines have specifically addressed this issue, and both long content and short content have equal chances to rank.\n\nBehavioral Feedback\n\nAll major search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Live and Ask collect user feedback about web pages. They look at search queries, prior search queries, time interval between those queries and semantic relationships in order to learn more about intent. They also track click through rates for different listings. If, for example, users click on a listing and then go back right away, search engines may remove that listing and artificially lower its position for one or more keywords.\n\nThis brings up the fact that user experience is becoming an important part of SEO. As search engines collect more data, they are constantly learning to interpret it. As they get better at it, retaining users on your pages for a certain time period (maybe a benchmark for an industry) may become an important factor in the SEO game.\n\nBehavior feedback is currently used in personalized search.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seochat.com/c/a/search-engine-news/the-history-of-search-and-search-technology/|accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>\n-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Database search engine]]\n*[[Enterprise search]]\n*[[Search engine]]\n*[[Disambiguation]]\n*[[Search engine indexing]]\n*[[Web crawler]]\n*[[Structured Search]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.searchtools.com/info/database-search.html Searching for Text Information in Databases]\n* [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Searchency Searchency]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Search Engine Technology}}\n[[Category:Internet search engines]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

S'\'\'\'Vocabulary mismatch\'\'\' is a common phenomenon in the usage of natural languages, occurring when different people name the same thing or concept differently.\n\nFurnas et al. (1987) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem.<ref>Furnas, G., et al, The Vocabulary Problem in Human-System Communication, Communications of the ACM, 1987, 30(11), pp. 964-971.</ref>  Their results show that on average 80% of the times different people (experts in the same field) will name the same thing differently.  There are usually tens of possible names that can be attributed to the same thing.  This research motivated the work on [[latent semantic indexing]].\n\nThe vocabulary mismatch between user created queries and relevant documents in a corpus causes the term mismatch problem in [[information retrieval]].  Zhao and Callan (2010)<ref>Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Term Necessity Prediction, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2010). Toronto, Canada, 2010.</ref> were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem in a retrieval setting.  Their results show that an average query term fails to appear in 30-40% of the documents that are relevant to the user query.  They also showed that this probability of mismatch is a central probability in one of the fundamental probabilistic retrieval models, the [[Binary Independence Model]].  They developed novel term weight prediction methods that can lead to potentially 50-80% accuracy gains in retrieval over strong keyword retrieval models.  Further research along the line shows that expert users can use Boolean Conjunctive Normal Form expansion to improve retrieval performance by 50-300% over unexpanded keyword queries.<ref name="cnf">Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Automatic term mismatch diagnosis for selective query expansion, SIGIR 2012.</ref>\n\n== Techniques that solve mismatch ==\nZhao provided a survey of common techniques that can solve mismatch in the dissertation on term mismatch.<ref>Zhao, L., Modeling and Solving Term Mismatch in Full-text Retrieval, PhD Dissertation, Carnegie Mellon University, 2012.

S'In [[information retrieval]], \'\'\'Okapi BM25\'\'\' is a [[ranking function]] used by [[search engine]]s to rank matching documents according to their [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] to a given search query. It is based on the [[Probabilistic relevance model|probabilistic retrieval framework]] developed in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Stephen E. Robertson]], [[Karen Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones]], and others.\n\nThe name of the actual ranking function is BM25. To set the right context, however, it usually referred to as "Okapi BM25", since the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at [[London]]\'s [[City University, London|City University]] in the 1980s and 1990s, was the first system to implement this function.\n\nBM25, and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent state-of-the-art [[TF-IDF]]-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval, such as [[web search]].\n\n== The ranking function ==\n\nBM25 is a [[Bag of words model|bag-of-words]] retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document, regardless of the inter-relationship between the query terms within a document (e.g., their relative proximity). It is not a single function, but actually a whole family of scoring functions, with slightly different components and parameters. One of the most prominent instantiations of the function is as follows.\n\nGiven a query <math>Q</math>, containing keywords <math>q_1, ..., q_n</math>, the BM25 score of a document <math>D</math> is:\n\n:<math> \\text{score}(D,Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{IDF}(q_i) \\cdot \\frac{f(q_i, D) \\cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \\cdot (1 - b + b \\cdot \\frac{|D|}{\\text{avgdl}})},</math>\n\nwhere <math>f(q_i, D)</math> is <math>q_i</math>\'s [[term frequency]] in the document <math>D</math>, <math>|D|</math> is the length of the document <math>D</math> in words, and <math>avgdl</math> is the average document length in the text collection from which documents are drawn. <math>k_1</math> and <math>b</math> are free parameters, usually chosen, in absence of an advanced optimization, as <math>k_1 \\in [1.2,2.0]</math> and <math>b = 0.75</math>.<ref>Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, Hinrich Sch\xc3\xbctze. \'\'An Introduction to Information Retrieval\'\', Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 233.</ref> <math>\\text{IDF}(q_i)</math> is the IDF ([[inverse document frequency]]) weight of the query term <math>q_i</math>. It is usually computed as:\n\n:<math>\\text{IDF}(q_i) = \\log \\frac{N - n(q_i) + 0.5}{n(q_i) + 0.5},</math>\n\nwhere <math>N</math> is the total number of documents in the collection, and <math>n(q_i)</math> is the number of documents containing <math>q_i</math>.\n\nThere are several interpretations for IDF and slight variations on its formula. In the original BM25 derivation, the IDF component is derived from the [[Binary Independence Model]].\n\nPlease note that the above formula for IDF shows potentially major drawbacks when using it for terms appearing in more than half of the corpus documents. These terms\' IDF is negative, so for any two almost-identical documents, one which contains the term and one which does not contain it, the latter will possibly get a larger score.\nThis means that terms appearing in more than half of the corpus will provide negative contributions to the final document score. This is often an undesirable behavior, so many real-world applications would deal with this IDF formula in a different way:\n\n* Each summand can be given a floor of 0, to trim out common terms;\n* The IDF function can be given a floor of a constant <math>\\epsilon</math>, to avoid common terms being ignored at all;\n* The IDF function can be replaced with a similarly shaped one which is non-negative, or strictly positive to avoid terms being ignored at all.\n\n== IDF information theoretic interpretation ==\nHere is an interpretation from information theory. Suppose a query term <math>q</math> appears in <math>n(q)</math> documents. Then a randomly picked document <math>D</math> will contain the term with probability <math>\\frac{n(q)}{N}</math> (where <math>N</math> is again the cardinality of the set of documents in the collection). Therefore, the [[information]] content of the message "<math>D</math> contains <math>q</math>" is:\n\n:<math>-\\log \\frac{n(q)}{N} = \\log \\frac{N}{n(q)}.</math>\n\nNow suppose we have two query terms <math>q_1</math> and <math>q_2</math>. If the two terms occur in documents entirely independently of each other, then the probability of seeing both <math>q_1</math> and <math>q_2</math> in a randomly picked document <math>D</math> is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{n(q_1)}{N} \\cdot \\frac{n(q_2)}{N},</math>\n\nand the information content of such an event is:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\log \\frac{N}{n(q_i)}.</math>\n\nWith a small variation, this is exactly what is expressed by the IDF component of BM25.\n\n== Modifications ==\n* At the extreme values of the coefficient <math>b</math> BM25 turns into ranking functions known as \'\'\'BM11\'\'\' (for <math>b=1</math>) and \'\'\'BM15\'\'\' (for <math>b=0</math>).<ref>http://xapian.org/docs/bm25.html</ref>\n* \'\'\'BM25F\'\'\'<ref>Hugo Zaragoza, Nick Craswell, Michael Taylor, Suchi Saria, and Stephen Robertson.

BM25+ was developed to address one deficiency of the standard BM25 in which the component of term frequency normalization by document length is not properly lower-bounded; as a result of this deficiency, long documents which do match the query term can often be scored unfairly by BM25 as having a similar relevancy to shorter documents that do not contain the query term at all. The scoring formula of BM25+ only has one additional free parameter <math>\\delta</math> (a default value is <math>1.0</math> in absence of a training data) as compared with BM25:\n\n:<math> \\text{score}(D,Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{IDF}(q_i) \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{f(q_i, D) \\cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \\cdot (1 - b + b \\cdot \\frac{|D|}{\\text{avgdl}})} + \\delta \\right]</math>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite conference|author=Stephen E.

S'\'\'\'Human\xe2\x80\x93computer information retrieval\'\'\' (\'\'\'HCIR\'\'\') is the study of [[information retrieval]] techniques that bring human intelligence into the [[search engine|search]] process. The fields of [[human\xe2\x80\x93computer interaction]] (HCI) and information retrieval (IR) have both developed innovative techniques to address the challenge of navigating complex information spaces, but their insights have often failed to cross disciplinary borders. Human\xe2\x80\x93computer information retrieval has emerged in academic research and industry practice to bring together research in the fields of IR and HCI, in order to create new kinds of search systems that depend on continuous human control of the search process.\n\n== History ==\n\nThis term \'\'human\xe2\x80\x93computer information retrieval\'\' was coined by Gary Marchionini in a series of lectures delivered between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=march2006>Marchionini, G. (2006). Toward Human-Computer Information Retrieval Bulletin, in June/July 2006 Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science. Available online at http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Jun-06/marchionini.html.</ref> Marchionini\xe2\x80\x99s main thesis is that "HCIR aims to empower people to explore large-scale information bases but demands that people also take responsibility for this control by expending cognitive and physical energy."\n\nIn 1996 and 1998, a pair of workshops at the [[University of Glasgow]] on [[information retrieval]] and [[human\xe2\x80\x93computer interaction]] sought to address the overlap between these two fields. Marchionini notes the impact of the [[World Wide Web]] and the sudden increase in [[information literacy]] \xe2\x80\x93 changes that were only embryonic in the late 1990s.\n\nA few workshops have focused on the intersection of IR and HCI. The Workshop on Exploratory Search, initiated by the [[University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab]] in 2005, alternates between the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval]] (SIGIR) and [[CHI (conference)|Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction]] (CHI) conferences. Also in 2005, the [[European Science Foundation]] held an Exploratory Workshop on Information Retrieval in Context. Then, the first Workshop on Human Computer Information Retrieval was held in 2007 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].\n\n== What is HCIR? ==\n\nHCIR includes various aspects of IR and HCI. These include [[exploratory search]], in which users generally combine querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation; information retrieval in context (i.e., taking into account aspects of the user or environment that are typically not reflected in a query); and interactive information retrieval, which Peter Ingwersen defines as "the interactive communication processes that occur during the retrieval of information by involving all the major participants in information retrieval (IR), i.e. the user, the intermediary, and the IR system."<ref name=ingwer1992>Ingwersen, P. (1992). Information Retrieval Interaction. London: Taylor Graham. Available online at http://vip.db.dk/pi/iri/index.htm.</ref>\n\nA key concern of HCIR is that IR systems intended for human users be implemented and evaluated in a way that reflects the needs of those users.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mira working group (1996). Evaluation Frameworks for Interactive Multimedia Information Retrieval Applications|url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mira/}}</ref>\n\nMost modern IR systems employ a [[ranking|ranked]] retrieval model, in which the documents are scored based on the [[probability]] of the document\xe2\x80\x99s [[relevance]] to the query.<ref>Grossman, D. and Frieder, O. (2004). Information Retrieval Algorithms and Heuristics. </ref> In this model, the system only presents the top-ranked documents to the user. This systems are typically evaluated based on their [[Information_retrieval#Average precision of precision and recall|mean average precision]] over a set of benchmark queries from organizations like the [[Text Retrieval Conference]] (TREC).\n\nBecause of its emphasis in using human intelligence in the information retrieval process, HCIR requires different evaluation models \xe2\x80\x93 one that combines evaluation of the IR and HCI components of the system. A key area of research in HCIR involves evaluation of these systems. Early work on interactive information retrieval, such as Juergen Koenemann and [[Nicholas J. Belkin]]\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 study of different levels of interaction for automatic query reformulation, leverage the standard IR measures of [[Information_retrieval#Precision|precision]] and [[Information_retrieval#Recall|recall]] but apply them to the results of multiple iterations of user interaction, rather than to a single query response.<ref name=koene1996>Koenemann, J. and Belkin, N. J. (1996). A case for interaction: a study of interactive information retrieval behavior and effectiveness. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Common Ground (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, April 13\xe2\x80\x9318, 1996). M. J. Tauber, Ed. CHI \xe2\x80\x9896. ACM Press, New York, NY, 205-212. Available online at http://sigchi.org/chi96/proceedings/papers/Koenemann/jk1_txt.htm.\n</ref> Other HCIR research, such as Pia Borlund\xe2\x80\x99s IIR evaluation model, applies a methodology more reminiscent of HCI, focusing on the characteristics of users, the details of experimental design, etc.<ref name=borlund2003>Borlund, P. (2003). The IIR evaluation model: a framework for evaluation of interactive information retrieval systems. Information Research, 8(3), Paper 152. Available online at http://informationr.net/ir/8-3/paper152.html.</ref>\n\n== Goals ==\n\nMarchionini put forth the following goals towards a system where the user has more control in determining relevant results.<ref name=march2006/>\n\nSystems should\n*no longer only deliver the relevant documents, but must also provide semantic information along with those documents\n*increase user responsibility as well as control; that is, information systems require human intellectual effort\n*have flexible architectures so they may evolve and adapt to increasingly more demanding and knowledgeable user bases\n*aim to be part of information ecology of personal and [[Collective memory|shared memories]] and tools rather than discrete standalone services\n*support the entire [[information life cycle]] (from creation to preservation) rather than only the dissemination or use phase\n*support tuning by end users and especially by information professionals who add value to information resources\n*be engaging and fun to use\n\nIn short, information retrieval systems are expected to operate in the way that good libraries do. Systems should help users to bridge the gap between data or information (in the very narrow, granular sense of these terms) and knowledge (processed data or information that provides the context necessary to inform the next iteration of an information seeking process). That is, good libraries provide both the information a patron needs as well as a partner in the learning process \xe2\x80\x94 the [[information professional]] \xe2\x80\x94 to navigate that information, make sense of it, preserve it, and turn it into knowledge (which in turn creates new, more informed information needs).\n\n== Techniques ==\n\nThe techniques associated with HCIR emphasize representations of information that use human intelligence to lead the user to relevant results. These techniques also strive to allow users to explore and digest the dataset without penalty, i.e., without expending unnecessary costs of time, mouse clicks, or context shift.\n\nMany [[search engines]] have features that incorporate HCIR techniques. [[Spelling suggestion]]s and [[query expansion|automatic query reformulation]] provide mechanisms for suggesting potential search paths that can lead the user to relevant results. These suggestions are presented to the user, putting control of selection and interpretation in the user\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\n\n[[Faceted search]] enables users to navigate information [[hierarchy|hierarchically]], going from a category to its sub-categories, but choosing the order in which the categories are presented. This contrasts with traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging. [[Faceted classification|Faceted navigation]], like taxonomic navigation, guides users by showing them available categories (or facets), but does not require them to browse through a hierarchy that may not precisely suit their needs or way of thinking.<ref>Hearst, M. (1999). User Interfaces and Visualization, Chapter 10 of Baeza-Yates, R. and Ribeiro-Neto, B., Modern Information Retrieval.</ref>\n\n[[Lookahead]] provides a general approach to penalty-free exploration. For example, various [[web applications]] employ [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] to automatically complete query terms and suggest popular searches. Another common example of lookahead is the way in which search engines annotate results with summary information about those results, including both static information (e.g., [[metadata]] about the objects) and "snippets" of document text that are most pertinent to the words in the search query.\n\n[[Relevance feedback]] allows users to guide an IR system by indicating whether particular results are more or less relevant.<ref>Rocchio, J. (1971). Relevance feedback in information retrieval. In: Salton, G (ed), The SMART Retrieval System.</ref>\n\nSummarization and [[analytics]] help users digest the results that come back from the query. Summarization here is intended to encompass any means of [[aggregate data|aggregating]] or [[data compression|compressing]] the query results into a more human-consumable form. Faceted search, described above, is one such form of summarization. Another is [[cluster analysis|clustering]], which analyzes a set of documents by grouping similar or co-occurring documents or terms. Clustering allows the results to be partitioned into groups of related documents. For example, a search for "java" might return clusters for [[Java (programming language)]], [[Java|Java (island)]], or [[Java (coffee)]].\n\n[[information visualization|Visual representation of data]] is also considered a key aspect of HCIR. The representation of summarization or analytics may be displayed as tables, charts, or summaries of aggregated data. Other kinds of [[information visualization]] that allow users access to summary views of search results include [[tag clouds]] and [[treemapping]].\n\n== References ==\n\n<References/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hcirworkshop/ |title=Workshops on Human Computer Information Retrieval}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.chiir.org/ |title=ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval (CHIIR)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human-computer information retrieval}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Human\xe2\x80\x93computer interaction]]'

S"'''Latent semantic mapping (LSM)''' is a data-driven framework to model globally meaningful relationships implicit in large volumes of (often textual) data. It is a generalization of [[latent semantic analysis]]. In information retrieval, LSA enables retrieval on the basis of conceptual content, instead of merely matching words between queries and documents.\n\nLSM was derived from earlier work on latent semantic analysis.  There are 3 main characteristics of latent semantic analysis: Discrete entities, usually in the form of words and documents, are mapped onto continuous vectors, the mapping involves a form of global correlation pattern, and dimensionality reduction is an important aspect of the analysis process. These constitute generic properties, and have been identified as potentially useful in a variety of different contexts.  This usefulness has encouraged great interest in LSM. The intended product of latent semantic mapping, is a data-driven framework for modeling relationships in large volumes of data.\n\n[[Mac OS X v10.5]] and later includes a [[Software framework|framework]] implementing latent semantic mapping.<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/TextFonts/Reference/LatentSemanticMapping/index.html API Reference: Latent Semantic Mapping Framework Reference<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Latent semantic analysis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal\n | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/79/32367/01511825.pdf\n | title=Latent semantic mapping [information retrieval]\n | author=Bellegarda, J.R.\n | date=2005\n}}\n* {{cite conference\n | url=https://www.securecms.com/ICASSP2006/Tutorial_06.asp\n | title=Latent semantic mapping: Principles and applications\n | author=J.

S'{{Information science}}\n\n\'\'\'Information retrieval\'\'\' (\'\'\'IR\'\'\') is the activity of obtaining [[information]] resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.  Searches can be based on [[metadata]] or on [[Full text search|full-text]] (or other content-based) indexing.\n\nAutomated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called "[[information overload]]". Many universities and [[public library|public libraries]] use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents. [[Web search engine]]s are the most visible [[Information retrieval applications|IR applications]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAn information retrieval process begins when a user enters a [[query string|query]] into the system. Queries are formal statements of [[information need]]s, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of [[relevance|relevancy]].\n\nAn object is an entity that is represented by information in a [[database]].

By 1970 several different techniques had been shown to perform well on small [[text corpora]] such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).<ref name="Singhal2001" /> Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), cosponsored the [[Text Retrieval Conference]] (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that [[scalability|scale]] to huge corpora. The introduction of [[web search engine]]s has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.\n\n== Model types ==\n[[File:Information-Retrieval-Models.png|thumb|500px|Categorization of IR-models (translated from [[:de:Informationsr\xc3\xbcckgewinnung#Klassifikation von Modellen zur Repr\xc3\xa4sentation nat\xc3\xbcrlichsprachlicher Dokumente|German entry]], original source [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/engbuchmid?isbn=0514&lng=eng&id= Dominik Kuropka]).]]\nFor effectively retrieving relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.\n\n=== First dimension: mathematical basis ===\n* \'\'Set-theoretic\'\' models represent documents as sets of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:\n** [[Standard Boolean model]]\n** [[Extended Boolean model]]\n** [[Fuzzy retrieval]]\n* \'\'Algebraic models\'\' represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.\n** [[Vector space model]]\n** [[Generalized vector space model]]\n** [[Topic-based vector space model|(Enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model]]\n** [[Extended Boolean model]]\n** [[Latent semantic indexing]] a.k.a. [[latent semantic analysis]]\n* \'\'Probabilistic models\'\' treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like the [[Bayes\' theorem]] are often used in these models.\n** [[Binary Independence Model]]\n** [[Probabilistic relevance model]] on which is based the [[Probabilistic relevance model (BM25)|okapi (BM25)]] relevance function\n** [[Uncertain inference]]\n** [[Language model]]s\n** [[Divergence-from-randomness model]]\n** [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]]\n* \'\'Feature-based retrieval models\'\' view documents as vectors of values of \'\'feature functions\'\' (or just \'\'features\'\') and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score, typically by [[learning to rank]] methods. Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query, and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just a yet another feature.\n\n=== Second dimension: properties of the model ===\n* \'\'Models without term-interdependencies\'\' treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the [[orthogonality]] assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independency]] assumption for term variables.\n* \'\'Models with immanent term interdependencies\'\' allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by [[dimension reduction|dimensional reduction]]) from the [[co-occurrence]] of those terms in the whole set of documents.\n* \'\'Models with transcendent term interdependencies\'\' allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They rely an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example a human or sophisticated algorithms.)\n\n== Performance and correctness measures ==\n{{main|Precision and recall}}\n\nMany different measures for evaluating the performance of information retrieval systems have been proposed. The measures require a collection of documents and a query. All common measures described here assume a ground truth notion of relevancy: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice queries may be [[ill-posed]] and there may be different shades of relevancy.\n\n=== Precision ===\n\nPrecision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevant]] to the user\'s information need.\n\n:<math> \\mbox{precision}=\\frac{|\\{\\mbox{relevant documents}\\}\\cap\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|}{|\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|} </math>\n\nIn [[binary classification]], precision is analogous to [[positive predictive value]]. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called \'\'precision at n\'\' or \'\'P@n\'\'.\n\nNote that the meaning and usage of "precision" in the field of Information Retrieval differs from the definition of [[accuracy and precision]] within other branches of science and [[statistics]].\n\n=== Recall ===\n\nRecall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.\n\n:<math>\\mbox{recall}=\\frac{|\\{\\mbox{relevant documents}\\}\\cap\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|}{|\\{\\mbox{relevant documents}\\}|} </math>\n\nIn binary classification, recall is often called [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]. So it can be looked at as \'\'the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query\'\'.\n\nIt is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.\n\n=== Fall-out ===\nThe proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:\n\n:<math> \\mbox{fall-out}=\\frac{|\\{\\mbox{non-relevant documents}\\}\\cap\\{\\mbox{retrieved documents}\\}|}{|\\{\\mbox{non-relevant documents}\\}|} </math>\n\nIn binary classification, fall-out is closely related to [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] and is equal to <math>(1-\\mbox{specificity})</math>. It can be looked at as \'\'the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query\'\'.\n\nIt is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query.\n\n=== F-measure ===\n{{main|F-score}}\nThe weighted [[harmonic mean]] of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{(\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall})}.\\,</math>\n\nThis is also known as the <math>F_1</math> measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.\n\nThe general formula for non-negative real <math>\\beta</math> is:\n:<math>F_\\beta = \\frac{(1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot (\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall})}{(\\beta^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall})}\\,</math>.\n\nTwo other commonly used F measures are the <math>F_{2}</math> measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the <math>F_{0.5}</math> measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.\n\nThe F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that <math>F_\\beta</math> "measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches <math>\\beta</math> times as much importance to recall as precision".  It is based on van Rijsbergen\'s effectiveness measure <math>E = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\alpha}{P} + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{R}}</math>.  Their relationship is <math>F_\\beta = 1 - E</math> where <math>\\alpha=\\frac{1}{1 + \\beta^2}</math>.\n\n=== Average precision ===\n<!-- [[Average precision]] redirects here -->\nPrecision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision <math>p(r)</math> as a function of recall <math>r</math>.

This measure is highly correlated to Average Precision. Also, Precision is equal to Recall at the \'\'\'R\'\'\'-th position.\n\n=== Mean average precision ===\n<!-- [[Mean average precision]] redirects here -->\nMean average precision for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query.\n:<math> \\operatorname{MAP} = \\frac{\\sum_{q=1}^Q \\operatorname{AveP(q)}}{Q} \\!</math>\nwhere \'\'Q\'\' is the number of queries.\n\n=== Discounted cumulative gain ===\n{{main|Discounted cumulative gain}}\nDCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result.\n\nThe DCG accumulated at a particular rank position <math>p</math> is defined as:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{DCG_{p}} = rel_{1} + \\sum_{i=2}^{p} \\frac{rel_{i}}{\\log_{2}i}. </math>\n\nSince result set may vary in size among different queries or systems, to compare performances the normalised version of DCG uses an ideal DCG. To this end, it sorts documents of a result list by relevance, producing an ideal DCG at position p (<math>IDCG_p</math>), which normalizes the score:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{nDCG_{p}} = \\frac{DCG_{p}}{IDCG{p}}. </math>\n\nThe nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the <math>DCG_p</math> will be the same as the <math>IDCG_p</math> producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable.\n\n=== Other Measures ===\n* [[Mean reciprocal rank]]\n* [[Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficient]]\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n* Before the \'\'\'1900s\'\'\'\n*: \'\'\'1801\'\'\': [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] invents the [[Jacquard loom]], the first machine to use punched cards to control a sequence of operations.\n*: \'\'\'1880s\'\'\': [[Herman Hollerith]] invents an electro-mechanical data tabulator using punch cards as a machine readable medium.\n*: \'\'\'1890\'\'\' Hollerith [[Punched cards|cards]], [[keypunch]]es and [[Tabulating machine|tabulators]] used to process the [[1890 US Census]] data.\n* \'\'\'1920s-1930s\'\'\'\n*: [[Emanuel Goldberg]] submits patents for his "Statistical Machine\xe2\x80\x9d a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilmed documents.\n* \'\'\'1940s\xe2\x80\x931950s\'\'\'\n*: \'\'\'late 1940s\'\'\': The US military confronted problems of indexing and retrieval of wartime scientific research documents captured from Germans.\n*:: \'\'\'1945\'\'\': [[Vannevar Bush]]\'s \'\'[[As We May Think]]\'\' appeared in \'\'[[Atlantic Monthly]]\'\'.\n*:: \'\'\'1947\'\'\': [[Hans Peter Luhn]] (research engineer at IBM since 1941) began work on a mechanized punch card-based system for searching chemical compounds.\n*: \'\'\'1950s\'\'\': Growing concern in the US for a "science gap" with the USSR motivated, encouraged funding and provided a backdrop for mechanized literature searching systems (Allen Kent \'\'et al.\'\') and the invention of citation indexing ([[Eugene Garfield]]).\n*: \'\'\'1950\'\'\': The term "information retrieval" appears to have been coined by [[Calvin Mooers]].<ref>Mooers, Calvin N.; \'\'Theory Digital Handling Non-numerical Information\'\' (Zator Technical Bulletin No. 48) 5, cited in "information, n.".

S'A \'\'\'[[concept]] search\'\'\' (or conceptual search) is an automated [[information retrieval]] method that is used to search electronically stored [[unstructured data|unstructured text]] (for example, [[digital archive]]s, email, scientific literature, etc.) for information that is conceptually similar to the information provided in a search query.  In other words, the \'\'ideas\'\' expressed in the information retrieved in response to a concept search query are relevant to the ideas contained in the text of the query.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Why Concept Search?==\nConcept search techniques were developed because of limitations imposed by classical Boolean [[Search algorithm|keyword search]] technologies when dealing with large, unstructured digital collections of text.  Keyword searches often return results that include many non-relevant items ([[false positive]]s) or that exclude too many relevant items (false negatives) because of the effects of [[synonymy]] and [[polysemy]].  Synonymy means that one of two or more words in the same language have the same meaning, and polysemy means that many individual words have more than one meaning.\n\nPolysemy is a major obstacle for all computer systems that attempt to deal with human language.  In English, most frequently used terms have several common meanings.  For example, the word fire can mean: a combustion activity; to terminate employment; to launch, or to excite (as in fire up).  For the 200 most-polysemous terms in English, the typical verb has more than twelve common meanings, or senses.  The typical noun from this set has more than eight common senses.  For the 2000 most-polysemous terms in English, the typical verb has more than eight common senses and the typical noun has more than five.<ref>Bradford, R. B., Word Sense Disambiguation, [[Content Analyst Company]], LLC, U.S. Patent 7415462, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the problems of polysemous and synonymy, keyword searches can exclude inadvertently [[misspelled]] words as well as the variations on the [[Stemming|stems]] (or roots) of words (for example, strike vs. striking).  Keyword searches are also susceptible to errors introduced by [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) scanning processes, which can introduce [[random error]]s into the text of documents (often referred to as [[noisy text]]) during the scanning process.\n\nA concept search can overcome these challenges by employing [[word sense disambiguation]] (WSD),<ref>R. Navigli, [http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/ACM_Survey_2009_Navigli.pdf Word Sense Disambiguation: A Survey], ACM Computing Surveys, 41(2), 2009.</ref> and other techniques, to help it derive the actual meanings of the words, and their underlying concepts, rather than by simply matching character strings like keyword search technologies.\n\n==Approaches to Concept Search==\nIn general, information retrieval research and technology can be divided into two broad categories: semantic and statistical. Information retrieval systems that fall into the semantic category will attempt to implement some degree of syntactic and [[Semantic analysis (machine learning)|semantic analysis]] of the [[natural language]] text that a human user would provide (also see [[computational linguistics]]).  Systems that fall into the statistical category will find results based on statistical measures of how closely they match the query.  However, systems in the semantic category also often rely on statistical methods to help them find and retrieve information.<ref>Greengrass, E., Information Retrieval: A Survey, 2000.</ref>\n\nEfforts to provide information retrieval systems with semantic processing capabilities have basically used three different approaches:\n\n* Auxiliary structures\n* Local [[co-occurrence]] statistics\n* Transform techniques (particularly [[matrix decomposition]]s)\n\n===Auxiliary Structures===\nA variety of techniques based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) have been applied to semantic processing, and most of them have relied on the use of auxiliary structures such as [[controlled vocabularies]] and [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]].  Controlled vocabularies (dictionaries and thesauri), and ontologies allow broader terms, narrower terms, and related terms to be incorporated into queries.<ref>Dubois, C., The Use of Thesauri in Online Retrieval, Journal of Information Science, 8(2), 1984 March, pp. 63-66.</ref> Controlled vocabularies are one way to overcome some of the most severe constraints of Boolean keyword queries.  Over the years, additional auxiliary structures of general interest, such as the large synonym sets of [[WordNet]], have been constructed.<ref>Miller, G., Special Issue, [http://www.mit.edu/~6.863/spring2009/readings/5papers.pdf WordNet: An On-line Lexical Database], Intl. Journal of Lexicography, 3(4), 1990.</ref>  It was shown that concept search that is based on auxiliary structures, such as [[WordNet]], can be efficiently implemented by reusing retrieval models and data structures of classical [[Information Retrieval]].<ref>Fausto Giunchiglia, Uladzimir Kharkevich, and Ilya Zaihrayeu. [http://www.ulakha.com/concept-search-eswc2009.html Concept Search], In Proceedings of European Semantic Web Conference, 2009.</ref>  Later approaches have implemented grammars to expand the range of semantic constructs.  The creation of data models that represent sets of concepts within a specific domain (\'\'domain ontologies\'\'), and which can incorporate the relationships among terms, has also been implemented in recent years.\n\nHandcrafted controlled vocabularies contribute to the efficiency and comprehensiveness of information retrieval and related text analysis operations, but they work best when topics are narrowly defined and the terminology is standardized.  Controlled vocabularies require extensive human input and oversight to keep up with the rapid evolution of language.  They also are not well suited to the growing volumes of unstructured text covering an unlimited number of topics and containing thousands of unique terms because new terms and topics need to be constantly introduced.  Controlled vocabularies are also prone to capturing a particular world view at a specific point in time, which makes them difficult to modify if concepts in a certain topic area change.<ref name="Bradford, R. B. 2008">Bradford, R. B., Why LSI? [[Latent Semantic Indexing]] and Information Retrieval, White Paper, [[Content Analyst Company]], LLC, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Local Co-occurrence Statistics===\nInformation retrieval systems incorporating this approach count the number of times that groups of terms appear together (co-occur) within a [[sliding window]] of terms or sentences (for example, \xc2\xb1 5 sentences or \xc2\xb1 50 words) within a document.  It is based on the idea that words that occur together in similar contexts have similar meanings.  It is local in the sense that the sliding window of terms and sentences used to determine the co-occurrence of terms is relatively small.\n\nThis approach is simple, but it captures only a small portion of the semantic information contained in a collection of text.  At the most basic level, numerous experiments have shown that approximately only \xc2\xbc of the information contained in text is local in nature.<ref>Landauer, T., and Dumais, S., A Solution to Plato\'s Problem: The Latent Semantic Analysis Theory of Acquisition, Induction, and Representation of Knowledge, Psychological Review, 1997, 104(2), pp. 211-240.</ref>   In addition, to be most effective, this method requires prior knowledge about the content of the text, which can be difficult with large, unstructured document collections.<ref name="Bradford, R. B. 2008"/>\n\n===Transform Techniques===\nSome of the most powerful approaches to semantic processing are based on the use of mathematical transform techniques.  [[Matrix decomposition]] techniques have been the most successful.  Some widely used matrix decomposition techniques include the following:<ref>Skillicorn, D., Understanding Complex Datasets: Data Mining with Matrix Decompositions, CRC Publishing, 2007.</ref>\n\n* [[Independent component analysis]]\n* Semi-discrete decomposition\n* [[Non-negative matrix factorization]]\n* [[Singular value decomposition]]\n\nMatrix decomposition techniques are data-driven, which avoids many of the drawbacks associated with auxiliary structures.  They are also global in nature, which means they are capable of much more robust information extraction and representation of semantic information than techniques based on local co-occurrence statistics.<ref name="Bradford, R. B. 2008"/>\n\nIndependent component analysis is a technique that creates sparse representations in an automated fashion,<ref>Honkela, T., Hyvarinen, A. and Vayrynen, J. WordICA - Emergence of linguistic representations for words by independent component analysis. Natural Language Engineering, 16(3):277-308, 2010</ref> and the semi-discrete and non-negative matrix approaches sacrifice accuracy of representation in order to reduce computational complexity.<ref name="Bradford, R. B. 2008"/>\n\nSingular value decomposition (SVD) was first applied to text at Bell Labs in the late 1980s. It was used as the foundation for a technique called [[Latent semantic indexing|Latent Semantic Indexing]] (LSI) because of its ability to find the semantic meaning that is latent in a collection of text.  At first, the SVD was slow to be adopted because of the resource requirements needed to work with large datasets.  However, the use of LSI has significantly expanded in recent years as earlier challenges in scalability and performance have been overcome.  LSI is being used in a variety of information retrieval and text processing applications, although its primary application has been for concept searching and automated document categorization.<ref>Dumais, S., Latent Semantic Analysis, ARIST Review of Information Science and Technology, vol. 38, Chapter 4, 2004.</ref>\n\n==Uses of Concept Search==\n* \'\'\'[[eDiscovery]]\'\'\' - Concept-based search technologies are increasingly being used for Electronic Document Discovery (EDD or eDiscovery) to help enterprises prepare for litigation.  In eDiscovery, the ability to cluster, categorize, and search large collections of unstructured text on a conceptual basis is much more efficient than traditional linear review techniques.  Concept-based searching is becoming accepted as a reliable and efficient search method that is more likely to produce relevant results than keyword or Boolean searches.<ref>Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola of the U.S. District Court for the District of Washington, D.C.\nDisability Rights Council v. Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, 242 FRD 139 (D. D.C. 2007), citing George L. Paul & Jason R. Baron, "Information Inflation: Can the Legal System Adapt?" 13 Rich. J.L. & Tech. 10 (2007).</ref>\n\n* \'\'\'[[Enterprise Search]] and Enterprise Content Management (ECM)\'\'\' - Concept search technologies are being widely used in enterprise search.  As the volume of information within the enterprise grows, the ability to cluster, categorize, and search large collections of unstructured text on a conceptual basis has become essential.  In 2004 the Gartner Group estimated that professionals spend 30 percent of their time searching, retrieving, and managing information.<ref name="Laplanche, R. 2004">Laplanche, R., Delgado, J., Turck, M., Concept Search Technology Goes Beyond Keywords, Information Outlook, July 2004.</ref>  The research company IDC found that a 2,000-employee corporation can save up to $30 million per year by reducing the time employees spend trying to find information and duplicating existing documents.<ref name="Laplanche, R. 2004"/>\n\n* \'\'\'[[Content-based image retrieval|Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)]]\'\'\' - Content-based approaches are being used for the semantic retrieval of digitized images and video from large visual corpora.  One of the earliest content-based image retrieval systems to address the semantic problem was the ImageScape search engine.  In this system, the user could make direct queries for multiple visual objects such as sky, trees, water, etc. using spatially positioned icons in a WWW index containing more than ten million images and videos using keyframes.  The system used information theory to determine the best features for minimizing uncertainty in the classification.<ref name="Lew, M. S. 2006">Lew, M. S., Sebe, N., Djeraba, C., Jain, R., Content-based Multimedia Information Retrieval: State of the Art and Challenges, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications, February 2006.</ref>  The semantic gap is often mentioned in regard to CBIR.  The semantic gap refers to the gap between the information that can be extracted from visual data and the interpretation that the same data have for a user in a given situation.<ref>Datta R., Joshi, D., Li J., Wang, J. Z., [http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/review/JOUR/datta.pdf Image Retrieval: Ideas, Influences, and Trends of the New Age], ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 40, No. 2, April 2008.</ref>  The [http://www.liacs.nl/~mir ACM SIGMM Workshop on Multimedia Information Retrieval] is dedicated to studies of CBIR.\n\n* \'\'\'Multimedia and Publishing\'\'\' - Concept search is used by the multimedia and publishing industries to provide users with access to news, technical information, and subject matter expertise coming from a variety of unstructured sources.  Content-based methods for multimedia information retrieval (MIR) have become especially important when text annotations are missing or incomplete.<ref name="Lew, M. S. 2006"/>\n\n* \'\'\'Digital Libraries and Archives\'\'\' - Images, videos, music, and text items in digital libraries and digital archives are being made accessible to large groups of users (especially on the Web) through the use of concept search techniques.  For example, the Executive Daily Brief (EDB), a business information monitoring and alerting product developed by EBSCO Publishing, uses concept search technology to provide corporate end users with access to a digital library containing a wide array of business content.  In a similar manner, the [[Music Genome Project]] spawned Pandora, which employs concept searching to spontaneously create individual music libraries or \'\'virtual\'\' radio stations.\n\n* \'\'\'Genomic Information Retrieval (GIR)\'\'\' - Genomic Information Retrieval (GIR) uses concept search techniques applied to genomic literature databases to overcome the ambiguities of scientific literature.\n\n* \'\'\'Human Resources Staffing and Recruiting\'\'\' - Many human resources staffing and recruiting organizations have adopted concept search technologies to produce highly relevant resume search results that provide more accurate and relevant candidate resumes than loosely related keyword results.\n\n==Effective Concept Searching==\nThe effectiveness of a concept search can depend on a variety of elements including the dataset being searched and the search engine that is used to process queries and display results. However, most concept search engines work best for certain kinds of queries:\n\n* Effective queries are composed of enough text to adequately convey the intended concepts.  Effective queries may include full sentences, paragraphs, or even entire documents.  Queries composed of just a few words are not as likely to return the most relevant results.\n\n* Effective queries do not include concepts in a query that are not the object of the search.  Including too many unrelated concepts in a query can negatively affect the relevancy of the result items.  For example, searching for information about \'\'boating on the Mississippi River\'\' would be more likely to return relevant results than a search for \'\'boating on the Mississippi River on a rainy day in the middle of the summer in 1967.\'\'\n\n* Effective queries are expressed in a full-text, natural language style similar in style to the documents being searched.  For example, using queries composed of excerpts from an introductory science textbook would not be as effective for concept searching if the dataset being searched is made up of advanced, college-level science texts.  Substantial queries that better represent the overall concepts, styles, and language of the items for which the query is being conducted are generally more effective.\n\nAs with all search strategies, experienced searchers generally refine their queries through multiple searches, starting with an initial \'\'seed\'\' query to obtain conceptually relevant results that can then be used to compose and/or refine additional queries for increasingly more relevant results.  Depending on the search engine, using query concepts found in result documents can be as easy as selecting a document and performing a \'\'find similar\'\' function.  Changing a query by adding terms and concepts to improve result relevance is called \'\'[[query expansion]]\'\'.<ref>[[Stephen Robertson (computer scientist)|Robertson, S. E.]], [[Karen Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones|Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones, K.]], Simple, Proven Approaches to Text Retrieval, Technical Report, University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, December 1994.</ref> The use of [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]] such as WordNet has been studied to expand queries with conceptually-related words.<ref>Navigli, R., Velardi, P. [http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~fabio/ATEM03/navigli-ecml03-atem.pdf An Analysis of Ontology-based Query Expansion Strategies]. \'\'Proc. of Workshop on Adaptive Text Extraction and Mining (ATEM 2003)\'\', in the \'\'14th European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML 2003)\'\', Cavtat-Dubrovnik, Croatia, September 22-26th, 2003, pp.&nbsp;42\xe2\x80\x9349</ref>\n\n==Relevance Feedback==\n[[Relevance feedback]] is a feature that helps users determine if the results returned for their queries meet their information needs.  In other words, relevance is assessed relative to an information need, not a query.  A document is relevant if it addresses the stated information need, not because it just happens to contain all the words in the query.<ref name="Manning, C. D. 2008">Manning, C. D., Raghavan P., Sch\xc3\xbctze H., Introduction to Information Retrieval, Cambridge University Press, 2008.</ref>   It is a way to involve users in the retrieval process in order to improve the final result set.<ref name="Manning, C. D. 2008"/> Users can refine their queries based on their initial results to improve the quality of their final results.\n\nIn general, concept search relevance refers to the degree of similarity between the concepts expressed in the query and the concepts contained in the results returned for the query.  The more similar the concepts in the results are to the concepts contained in the query, the more relevant the results are considered to be.  Results are usually ranked and sorted by relevance so that the most relevant results are at the top of the list of results and the least relevant results are at the bottom of the list.\n\nRelevance feedback has been shown to be very effective at improving the relevance of results.<ref name="Manning, C. D. 2008"/>   A concept search decreases the risk of missing important result items because all of the items that are related to the concepts in the query will be returned whether or not they contain the same words used in the query.<ref name="Laplanche, R. 2004"/>\n\n[[Ranking]] will continue to be a part of any modern information retrieval system.  However, the problems of heterogeneous data, scale, and non-traditional discourse types reflected in the text, along with the fact that search engines will increasingly be integrated components of complex information management processes, not just stand-alone systems, will require new kinds of system responses to a query.  For example, one of the problems with ranked lists is that they might not reveal relations that exist among some of the result items.<ref name="Callan, J. 2007">Callan, J., Allan, J., Clarke, C. L. A., Dumais, S., Evans, D., A., Sanderson, M., Zhai, C., Meeting of the MINDS: An Information Retrieval Research Agenda, ACM, SIGIR Forum, Vol. 41 No. 2, December 2007.</ref>\n\n==Guidelines for Evaluating a Concept Search Engine==\n# Result items should be relevant to the information need expressed by the concepts contained in the query statements, even if the terminology used by the result items is different from the terminology used in the query.\n# Result items should be sorted and ranked by relevance.\n# Relevant result items should be quickly located and displayed.  Even complex queries should return relevant results fairly quickly.\n# Query length should be \'\'non-fixed\'\', i.e., a query can be as long as deemed necessary.  A sentence, a paragraph, or even an entire document can be submitted as a query.\n# A concept query should not require any special or complex syntax.  The concepts contained in the query can be clearly and prominently expressed without using any special rules.\n# Combined queries using concepts, keywords, and metadata should be allowed.\n# Relevant portions of result items should be usable as query text simply by selecting the item and telling the search engine to \'\'find similar\'\' items.\n# Query-ready indexes should be created relatively quickly.\n# The search engine should be capable of performing Federated searches.  Federated searching enables concept queries to be used for simultaneously searching multiple datasources for information, which are then merged, sorted, and displayed in the results.\n# A concept search should not be affected by misspelled words, typographical errors, or OCR scanning errors in either the query text or in the text of the dataset being searched.\n\n==Search Engine Conferences and Forums==\nFormalized search engine evaluation has been ongoing for many years.  For example, the [[Text Retrieval Conference|Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)]] was started in 1992 to support research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large-scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies.  Most of today\'s commercial search engines include technology first developed in TREC.<ref>Croft, B., Metzler, D., Strohman, T., Search Engines, Information Retrieval in Practice, Addison Wesley, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a Japanese counterpart of TREC was launched, called National Institute of Informatics Test Collection for IR Systems (NTCIR).  NTCIR conducts a series of evaluation workshops for research in information retrieval, question answering, text summarization, etc.  A European series of workshops called the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) was started in 2001 to aid research in multilingual information access.  In 2002, the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) was established for the evaluation of content-oriented XML retrieval systems.\n\nPrecision and recall have been two of the traditional performance measures for evaluating information retrieval systems.  Precision is the fraction of the retrieved result documents that are relevant to the user\'s information need.  Recall is defined as the fraction of relevant documents in the entire collection that are returned as result documents.<ref name="Manning, C. D. 2008"/>\n\nAlthough the workshops and publicly available test collections used for search engine testing and evaluation have provided substantial insights into how information is managed and retrieved, the field has only scratched the surface of the challenges people and organizations face in finding, managing, and, using information now that so much information is available.<ref name="Callan, J. 2007"/>   Scientific data about how people use the information tools available to them today is still incomplete because experimental research methodologies haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to keep up with the rapid pace of change. Many challenges, such as contextualized search, personal information management, information integration, and task support, still need to be addressed.<ref name="Callan, J. 2007"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[approximate string matching]]\n* [[Compound term processing]]\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Computational linguistics]]\n* [[Information extraction]]\n* [[Latent semantic indexing]]\n* [[Latent semantic analysis]]\n* [[Semantic network]]\n* [[Semantic search]]\n* [[Semantic Web]]\n* [[Statistical semantics]]\n* [[Text mining]]\n* [[Word Sense Disambiguation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://trec.nist.gov/ Text Retrieval Conference (TREC)]\n* [http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ National Institute of Informatics Test Collection for IR Systems (NTCIR)]\n* [http://www.clef-campaign.org/ Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF)]\n* [http://inex.is.informatik.uni-duisburg.de/ Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX)]\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

S'\'\'\'KWIC\'\'\' is an acronym for \'\'\'Key Word In Context\'\'\', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].<ref>Manning, C. D., Sch\xc3\xbctze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999</ref> The system was based on a concept called \'\'keyword in titles\'\' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].<ref name="index">{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&pg=PA41&dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&f=false}}</ref>\n\nA \'\'\'KWIC\'\'\' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index. It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.\n\nFor example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very webpages, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum \'in context\' information (not shown in the following example).\n\n{| nowrap\n|-\n|align=right|KWIC is an\n|\'\'\'acronym\'\'\' for Key Word In Context, ...\n|page 1\n|-\n|align=right|...

This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a \'\'\'permuted index\'\'\' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading.

S'{{distinguish|Safeword}}\nIn [[computing]], \'\'\'stop words\'\'\' are words which are filtered out before or after [[Natural language processing|processing of natural language]] data (text).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/CBO9781139058452.002}}</ref> There is no single universal list of stop words used by all [[Natural language processing|processing of natural language]] tools, and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools specifically avoid removing these \'\'\'stop words\'\'\' to support [[phrase search]].\n\nAny group of words can be chosen as the stop words for a given purpose. For some [[search engine]]s, these are some of the most common, short [[function word]]s, such as \'\'the\'\', \'\'is\'\', \'\'at\'\', \'\'which\'\', and \'\'on\'\'. In this case, stop words can cause problems when searching for phrases that include them, particularly in names such as \'[[The Who]]\', \'[[The The]]\', or \'[[Take That]]\'. Other search engines remove some of the most common words\xe2\x80\x94including [[lexical word]]s, such as "want"\xe2\x80\x94from a query in order to improve performance.<ref>[http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/podcast-32 Stackoverflow]: "One of our major performance optimizations for the "related questions" query is removing the top 10,000 most common English dictionary words (as determined by Google search) before submitting the query to the SQL Server 2008 full text engine. It\xe2\x80\x99s shocking how little is left of most posts once you remove the top 10k English dictionary words. This helps limit and narrow the returned results, which makes the query dramatically faster".</ref>\n\n[[Hans Peter Luhn]], one of the pioneers in [[information retrieval]], is credited with coining the phrase and using the concept. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|cols=3}}\n* [[Text mining]]\n* [[Concept mining]]\n* [[Information extraction]]\n* [[Natural language processing]]\n* [[Query expansion]]\n* [[Stemming]]\n* [[Index (search engine)|Search engine indexing]]\n* [[Poison words]]\n* [[Function words]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/  List of English Stop Words (PHP array, CSV) ]\n* [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-stopwords.html  Full-Text Stopwords in MySQL ]\n* [http://www.textfixer.com/resources/common-english-words.txt English Stop Words (CSV)]\n* [http://mail.sarai.net/private/prc/Week-of-Mon-20080204/001656.html Hindi Stop Words]\n* [http://solariz.de/de/deutsche_stopwords.htm German Stop Words],[http://aniol-consulting.de/uebersicht-deutscher-stop-words/ German Stop Words and phrases], another list of [http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords/german.html German stop words]\n* [[:pl:Wikipedia:Stopwords|Polish Stop Words]]\n* [https://code.google.com/p/stop-words/ Collection of stop words in 29 languages]\n* [http://www.text-analytics101.com/2014/10/all-about-stop-words-for-text-mining.html A Detailed Explanation of Stop Words by Kavita Ganesan]\n\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Searching]]\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n{{SearchEngineOptimization}}'

S'{{disputed|date=March 2014}}\n{{inline|date=March 2014}}\n\'\'\'Document clustering\'\'\' (or \'\'\'text clustering\'\'\') is the application of [[cluster analysis]] to textual documents. It has applications in automatic document organization, [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] extraction and fast [[information retrieval]] or filtering.\n\n==Overview==\nDocument clustering involves the use of descriptors and descriptor extraction. Descriptors are sets of words that describe the contents within the cluster. Document clustering is generally considered to be a centralized process. Examples of document clustering include web document clustering for search users.\n\nThe application of document clustering can be categorized to two types, online and offline. Online applications are usually constrained by efficiency problems when compared offline applications.\n\nIn general, there are two common algorithms. The first one is the hierarchical based algorithm, which includes single link, complete linkage, group average and Ward\'s method.  By aggregating or dividing, documents can be clustered into hierarchical structure, which is suitable for browsing. However, such an algorithm usually suffers from efficiency problems. The other algorithm is developed using the [[K-means algorithm]] and its variants. These algorithms can further be classified as hard or soft clustering algorithms. Hard clustering computes a hard assignment \xe2\x80\x93 each document is a member of exactly one cluster. The assignment of soft clustering algorithms is soft \xe2\x80\x93 a document\xe2\x80\x99s assignment is a distribution over all clusters. In a soft assignment, a document has fractional membership in several clusters. [[Dimensionality reduction]] methods can be considered a subtype of soft clustering; for documents, these include [[latent semantic indexing]] ([[truncated singular value decomposition]] on term histograms)<ref>http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/16flat.pdf</ref> and [[topic model]]s.\n\nOther algorithms involve graph based clustering, ontology supported clustering and order sensitive clustering.\n\nGiven a clustering, it can be beneficial to automatically derive human-readable labels for the clusters. [[Cluster labeling|Various methods]] exist for this purpose.\n\n==Clustering in search engines==\nA [[web search engine]] often  returns thousands of pages in response to a broad query, making it difficult for users to browse or to identify relevant information.  Clustering methods can be used to automatically group the retrieved documents into a list of meaningful categories, as is achieved by Enterprise Search engines such as [[Northern Light Group|Northern Light]] and [[Vivisimo]], consumer search engines such as [http://www.polymeta.com/ PolyMeta] and [http://www.helioid.com Helioid], or open source software such as [[Carrot2]].\n\nExamples:\n\n* Clustering divides the results of a search for "cell" into groups like "biology," "battery," and "prison."\n\n* [http://FirstGov.gov FirstGov.gov], the official Web portal for the U.S. government, uses document clustering to automatically organize its search results into categories.  For example, if a user submits \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration\xe2\x80\x9d, next to their list of results they will see categories for \xe2\x80\x9cImmigration Reform\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cCitizenship and Immigration Services\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cEmployment\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cDepartment of Homeland Security\xe2\x80\x9d, and more.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\nPublications:\n* Nicholas O.

S'\'\'\'Noisy text analytics\'\'\' is a process of [[information extraction]] whose goal is to automatically extract structured or semistructured information from [[noisy text|noisy unstructured text data]]. While [[Text analytics]] is a growing and mature field that has great value because of the huge amounts of data being produced, processing of noisy text is gaining in importance because a lot of common applications produce noisy text data. Noisy unstructured text data is found in informal settings such as [[online chat]], [[Text messaging|text messages]], [[e-mail]]s, [[message boards]], [[newsgroups]], [[blogs]], [[wikis]] and [[web pages]]. Also, text produced by processing spontaneous speech using [[automatic speech recognition]] and printed or handwritten text using [[optical character recognition]] contains processing noise. Text produced under such circumstances is typically highly noisy containing spelling errors, [[abbreviation]]s, non-standard words, false starts, repetitions, missing [[punctuation]]s, missing [[letter case]] information, pause filling words such as \xe2\x80\x9cum\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cuh\xe2\x80\x9d and other texting and [[speech disfluencies]]. Such text can be seen in large amounts in [[contact centre (business)|contact centers]], [[chat room]]s, [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) of text documents, [[short message service]] (SMS) text, etc. Documents with [[historical language]] can also be considered noisy with respect to today\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge about the language. Such text contains important historical, religious, ancient medical knowledge that is useful. The nature of the noisy text produced in all these contexts warrants moving beyond traditional text analysis techniques.\n\n== Techniques for noisy text analysis ==\nMissing punctuation and the use of non-standard words can often hinder standard [[natural language processing]] tools such as [[Part-of-speech tagging]]\nand [[parsing]]. Techniques to both learn from the noisy data and then to be able to process the noisy data are only now being developed. \n\n== Possible source of noisy text ==\n* [[World wide web]]: Poorly written text is found in web pages, [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[discussion forum]]s, [[newsgroups]]. Most of these data are unstructured and the style of writing is very different from, say, well-written news articles. Analysis for the web data is important because they are sources for market buzz analysis, market review, [[trend estimation]], etc. Also, because of the large amount of data, it is necessary to find efficient methods of [[information extraction]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[automatic summarization]] and analysis of these data.\n* [[Contact centre (business)|Contact centers]]: This is a general term for help desks, information lines and customer service centers operating in domains ranging from computer sales and support to mobile phones to apparels. On an average a person in the developed world interacts at least once a week with a contact center agent. A typical contact center agent handles over a hundred calls per day. They operate in various modes such as voice, [[online chat]] and [[E-mail]]. The contact center industry produces gigabytes of data in the form of [[E-mails]], chat logs, voice conversation [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s, customer feedback, etc. A bulk of the contact center data is voice conversations. Transcription of these using state of the art [[automatic speech recognition]] results in text with 30-40% [[word error rate]]. Further, even written modes of communication like online chat between customers and agents and even the interactions over email tend to be noisy. Analysis of contact center data is essential for customer relationship management, customer satisfaction analysis, call modeling, customer profiling, agent profiling, etc., and it requires sophisticated techniques to handle poorly written text.\n* Printed Documents: Many libraries, government organizations and national defence organizations have vast repositories of [[hard copy]] documents. To retrieve and process the content from such documents, they need to be processed using [[Optical Character Recognition]]. In addition to printed text, these documents may also contain handwritten annotations. OCRed text can be highly noisy depending on the font size, quality of the print etc. It can range from 2-3% [[word error rate]]s to as high as 50-60% [[word error rate]]s. Handwritten annotations can be particularly hard to decipher, and error rates can be quite high in their presence.\n* [[Text messaging|Short Messaging Service]] (SMS): Language usage over computer mediated discourses, like chats, emails and SMS texts, significantly differs from the standard form of the language. An urge towards shorter message length facilitating faster typing and the need for semantic clarity, shape the structure of this non-standard form known as the texting language.\n\n== References ==\n*[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ql711884654q/?p=c6beb20b8dfa4389b5e4daf2dd63618e&pi=0 "Special Issue on Noisy Text Analytics - International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (2007), Springer, Guest Editors Craig Knoblock, Daniel Lopresti, Shourya Roy and L.

S'\'\'\'Vector space model\'\'\' or \'\'\'term vector model\'\'\' is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as [[vector space|vectors]] of identifiers, such as, for example, index terms. It is used in [[information filtering]], [[information retrieval]], [[index (search engine)|index]]ing and relevancy rankings.  Its first use was in the [[SMART Information Retrieval System]].\n\n==Definitions==\n\nDocuments and queries are represented as vectors.\n\n:<math>d_j = ( w_{1,j} ,w_{2,j} , \\dotsc ,w_{t,j} )</math>\n:<math>q = ( w_{1,q} ,w_{2,q} , \\dotsc ,w_{n,q} )</math>\n\nEach [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] corresponds to a separate term. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero. Several different ways of computing these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed. One of the best known schemes is [[tf-idf]] weighting (see the example below).\n\nThe definition of \'\'term\'\' depends on the application. Typically terms are single words, [[keyword (linguistics)|keyword]]s, or longer phrases. If words are chosen to be the terms, the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary (the number of distinct words occurring in the [[text corpus|corpus]]).\n\nVector operations can be used to compare documents with queries.\n\n==Applications==\n\n[[Image:vector space model.jpg|right|250px]]\n\n[[Relevance (information retrieval)|Relevance]] [[ranking]]s of documents in a keyword search can be calculated, using the assumptions of [[semantic similarity|document similarities]] theory, by comparing the deviation of angles between each document vector and the original query vector where the query is represented as the same kind of vector as the documents.\n\nIn practice, it is easier to calculate the [[cosine]] of the angle between the vectors, instead of the angle itself:\n\n:<math>\n\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{\\mathbf{d_2} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}}{\\left\\| \\mathbf{d_2} \\right\\| \\left \\| \\mathbf{q} \\right\\|}\n</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\mathbf{d_2} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}</math> is the intersection (i.e. the [[dot product]]) of the document (d<sub>2</sub> in the figure to the right) and the query (q in the figure) vectors, <math>\\left\\| \\mathbf{d_2} \\right\\|</math> is the norm of vector d<sub>2</sub>, and <math>\\left\\| \\mathbf{q} \\right\\|</math> is the norm of vector q. The [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is calculated as such:\n\n:<math>\n\\left\\| \\mathbf{q} \\right\\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n q_i^2}\n</math>\n\nAs all vectors under consideration by this model are elementwise nonnegative, a cosine value of zero means that the query and document vector are [[orthogonal]] and have no match (i.e. the query term does not exist in the document being considered). See [[cosine similarity]] for further information.\n\n==Example: tf-idf weights==\n\nIn the classic vector space model proposed by [[Gerard Salton|Salton]], Wong and Yang <ref>[http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/361219.361220 G. Salton , A. Wong , C. S. Yang, A vector space model for automatic indexing], Communications of the ACM, v.18 n.11, p.613-620, Nov. 1975</ref> the term-specific weights in the document vectors are products of local and global parameters. The model is known as [[tf-idf|term frequency-inverse document frequency]] model. The weight vector for document \'\'d\'\' is <math>\\mathbf{v}_d = [w_{1,d}, w_{2,d}, \\ldots, w_{N,d}]^T</math>, where\n\n:<math>\nw_{t,d} = \\mathrm{tf}_{t,d} \\cdot \\log{\\frac{|D|}{|\\{d\' \\in D \\, | \\, t \\in d\'\\}|}}\n</math>\n\nand\n* <math>\\mathrm{tf}_{t,d}</math> is term frequency of term \'\'t\'\' in document \'\'d\'\' (a local parameter)\n* <math>\\log{\\frac{|D|}{|\\{d\' \\in D \\, | \\, t \\in d\'\\}|}}</math> is inverse document frequency (a global parameter). <math>|D|</math> is the total number of documents in the document set; <math>|\\{d\' \\in D \\, | \\, t \\in d\'\\}|</math> is the number of documents containing the term \'\'t\'\'.\n\nUsing the cosine the similarity between document \'\'d<sub>j</sub>\'\' and query \'\'q\'\' can be calculated as:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{sim}(d_j,q) = \\frac{\\mathbf{d_j} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}}{\\left\\| \\mathbf{d_j} \\right\\| \\left \\| \\mathbf{q} \\right\\|} = \\frac{\\sum _{i=1}^N w_{i,j}w_{i,q}}{\\sqrt{\\sum _{i=1}^N w_{i,j}^2}\\sqrt{\\sum _{i=1}^N w_{i,q}^2}}</math>\n\n==Advantages==\n\nThe vector space model has the following advantages over the [[Standard Boolean model]]:\n\n#Simple model based on linear algebra\n#Term weights not binary\n#Allows computing a continuous degree of similarity between queries and documents\n#Allows ranking documents according to their possible relevance\n#Allows partial matching\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe vector space model has the following limitations:\n\n#Long documents are poorly represented because they have poor similarity values (a small [[scalar product]] and a [[curse of dimensionality|large dimensionality]])\n#Search keywords must precisely match document terms; word [[substring]]s might result in a "[[false positive]] match"\n#Semantic sensitivity; documents with similar context but different term vocabulary won\'t be associated, resulting in a "[[false negative]] match".\n#The order in which the terms appear in the document is lost in the vector space representation.\n#Theoretically assumes terms are statistically independent. \n#Weighting is intuitive but not very formal. \n\nMany of these difficulties can, however, be overcome by the integration of various tools, including mathematical techniques such as [[singular value decomposition]] and [[lexical database]]s such as [[WordNet]].\n\n==Models based on and extending the vector space model==\n\nModels based on and extending the vector space model include:\n* [[Generalized vector space model]]\n* [[Latent semantic analysis]]\n* [[Term Discrimination]]\n* [[Rocchio Classification]]\n* [[random_indexing|Random Indexing]]\n\n==Software that implements the vector space model==\n\nThe following software packages may be of interest to those wishing to experiment with vector models and implement search services based upon them.\n\n===Free open source software===\n\n* [[Apache Lucene]].

S'{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}\n\'\'\'Mean reciprocal rank\'\'\' is a [[statistic]] measure for evaluating any process that produces a list of possible responses to a sample of queries, ordered by probability of correctness. The reciprocal rank of a query response is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of the rank of the first correct answer. The mean reciprocal rank is the average of the reciprocal ranks of results for a sample of queries Q:<ref>{{cite conference | title=Proceedings of the 8th Text Retrieval Conference | booktitle=TREC-8 Question Answering Track Report | author=E.M. Voorhees |year=1999 | pages=77&ndash;82}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\text{MRR} = \\frac{1}{|Q|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|Q|} \\frac{1}{\\text{rank}_i}. \\!</math>\n\nThe reciprocal value of the mean reciprocal rank corresponds to the [[harmonic mean]] of the ranks.\n\n== Example ==\nFor example, suppose we have the following three sample queries for a system that tries to translate English words to their plurals.  In each case, the system makes three guesses, with the first one being the one it thinks is most likely correct:\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n|-\n! Query\n! Results\n! Correct response\n! Rank\n!

S'{{Lowercase|title=tf\xe2\x80\x93idf}}\n{{More footnotes|date=July 2012}}\n\n\'\'\'tf\xe2\x80\x93idf\'\'\', short for \'\'\'term frequency\xe2\x80\x93inverse document frequency\'\'\', is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a [[document]] in a collection or [[Text corpus|corpus]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/CBO9781139058452.002}}</ref>{{rp|8}} It is often used as a weighting factor in [[information retrieval]] and [[text mining]].\nThe tf-idf value increases [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionally]] to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.\n\nVariations of the tf\xe2\x80\x93idf weighting scheme are often used by [[search engine]]s as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document\'s [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] given a user [[Information retrieval|query]]. tf\xe2\x80\x93idf can be successfully used for [[stop-words]] filtering in various subject fields including [[automatic summarization|text summarization]] and classification.\n\nOne of the simplest [[ranking function]]s is computed by summing the tf\xe2\x80\x93idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\n==Motivation==\nSuppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to determine which document is most relevant to the query "the brown cow". A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words "the", "brown", and "cow", but this still leaves many documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document and sum them all together; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its \'\'term frequency\'\'.\n\nHowever, because the term "the" is so common, this will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word "the" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms "brown" and "cow". The term "the" is not a good keyword to distinguish relevant and non-relevant documents and terms, unlike the less common words "brown" and "cow". Hence an \'\'inverse document frequency\'\' factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.\n\n==Definition==\ntf\xe2\x80\x93idf is the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document frequency. Various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics exist. In the case of the \'\'\'term frequency\'\'\' tf(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\'), the simplest choice is to use the \'\'raw frequency\'\' of a term in a document, i.e. the number of times that term \'\'t\'\' occurs in document \'\'d\'\'. If we denote the raw frequency of \'\'t\'\' by f(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\'), then the simple tf scheme is tf(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\') = f(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\'). Other possibilities include<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/CBO9780511809071.007}}</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\n* [[boolean data type|Boolean]] "frequencies": tf(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\') = 1 if \'\'t\'\' occurs in \'\'d\'\' and 0 otherwise;\n* [[logarithm]]ically scaled frequency: tf(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\') = 1 + log f(\'\'t\'\',\'\'d\'\'), or zero if f(\'\'t\'\', \'\'d\'\') is zero;\n* augmented frequency, to prevent a bias towards longer documents, e.g. raw frequency divided by the maximum raw frequency of any term in the document:\n:<math>\\mathrm{tf}(t,d) = 0.5 + \\frac{0.5 \\times \\mathrm{f}(t, d)}{\\max\\{\\mathrm{f}(w, d):w \\in d\\}}</math>\n\nThe \'\'\'inverse document frequency\'\'\' is a measure of how much information the word provides, that is, whether the term is common or rare across all documents. It is the logarithmically scaled fraction of the documents that contain the word, obtained by dividing the total number of [[documents]] by the number of documents containing the term, and then taking the logarithm of that [[quotient]].\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{idf}(t, D) =  \\log \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}</math>\n\nwith\n\n* <math>N</math>: total number of documents in the corpus\n* <math> |\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}| </math> : number of documents where the term <math> t </math> appears (i.e., <math> \\mathrm{tf}(t,d) \\neq 0</math>). If the term is not in the corpus, this will lead to a division-by-zero. It is therefore common to adjust the denominator to <math>1 + |\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|</math>.\n\nMathematically the base of the log function does not matter and constitutes a constant multiplicative factor towards the overall result.\n\nThen tf\xe2\x80\x93idf is calculated as\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{tfidf}(t,d,D) = \\mathrm{tf}(t,d) \\times \\mathrm{idf}(t, D)</math>\n\nA high weight in tf\xe2\x80\x93idf is reached by a high term [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] (in the given document) and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents; the weights hence tend to filter out common terms. Since the ratio inside the idf\'s log function is always greater than or equal to 1, the value of idf (and tf-idf) is greater than or equal to 0. As a term appears in more documents, the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1, bringing the idf and tf-idf closer to 0.\n\n==Justification of idf==\nIdf was introduced, as "term specificity", by [[Karen Sp\xc3\xa4rck Jones]] in a 1972 paper. Although it has worked well as a [[heuristic]], its theoretical foundations have been troublesome for at least three decades afterward, with many researchers trying to find [[information theory|information theoretic]] justifications for it.<ref name="understanding">{{cite doi|10.1108/00220410410560582}}</ref>\n\nSp\xc3\xa4rck Jones\'s own explanation didn\'t propose much theory, aside from a connection to [[Zipf\'s law]].<ref name="understanding"/> Attempts have been made to put idf on a [[probability theory|probabilistic]] footing,<ref>See also [http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/probability-estimates-in-practice-1.html#p:justificationofidf Probability estimates in practice] in \'\'Introduction to Information Retrieval\'\'.</ref> by estimating the probability that a given document {{mvar|d}} contains a term {{mvar|t}} as\n\n<math>\nP(t|d) = \\frac{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}{N}\n</math>\n\nso that we can define idf as\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{idf} & = -\\log P(t|d) \\\\\n             & = \\log \\frac{1}{P(t|d)} \\\\\n             & = \\log \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis probabilistic interpretation in turn takes the same form as that of [[self-information]]. However, applying such information-theoretic notions to problems in information retrieval leads to problems when trying to define the appropriate [[event space]]s for the required [[probability distribution]]s: not only documents need to be taken into account, but also queries and terms.<ref name="understanding"/>\n\n==Example of tf\xe2\x80\x93idf==\nSuppose we have term frequency tables for a collection consisting of only two documents, as listed on the right, then calculation of tf\xe2\x80\x93idf for the term "this" in document 1 is performed as follows.\n\n{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0;"\n|+ Document 2\n! Term\n! | Term Count\n|-\n| this || 1\n|-\n| is\n| 1\n|-\n| another\n| 2\n|-\n| example\n| 3\n|}\n\n{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0;"\n|+ Document 1\n! Term\n! Term Count\n|-\n| this || 1\n|-\n| is\n| 1\n|-\n| a\n| 2\n|-\n| sample\n| 1\n|}\n\nTf, in its basic form, is just the frequency that we look up in appropriate table. In this case, it\'s one.\n\nIdf is a bit more involved:\n:<math> \\mathrm{idf}(\\mathsf{this}, D) =  \\log \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}</math>\n\nThe numerator of the fraction is the number of documents, which is two. The number of documents in which "this" appears is also two, giving\n:<math> \\mathrm{idf}(\\mathsf{this}, D) =  \\log \\frac{2}{2} = 0</math>\n\nSo tf\xe2\x80\x93idf is zero for this term, and with the basic definition this is true of any term that occurs in all documents.\n\nA slightly more interesting example arises from the word "example", which occurs three times but in only one document. For this document, tf\xe2\x80\x93idf of "example" is:\n:<math>\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{example}, d_2) = 3</math>\n:<math>\\mathrm{idf}(\\mathsf{example}, D) = \\log \\frac{2}{1} \\approx 0.3010</math>\n:<math>\\mathrm{tfidf}(\\mathsf{example}, d_2) = \\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{example}, d_2) \\times \\mathrm{idf}(\\mathsf{example}, D) = 3 \\times 0.3010 \\approx 0.9030</math>\n\n(using the [[base 10 logarithm]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col||25em}}\n* [[Okapi BM25]]\n* [[Noun phrase]]\n* [[Word count]]\n* [[Vector space model]]\n* [[PageRank]]\n* [[Kullback\xe2\x80\x93Leibler divergence]]\n* [[Mutual information]]\n* [[Latent semantic analysis]]\n* [[Latent semantic indexing]]\n* [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Cite doi|10.1108/eb026526}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last1 = Salton | first1 = G | authorlink1 = Gerard Salton\n | last2 = McGill | first2 = M.

It was released under the ISC [[open source]] license in September 2014.\n\nGLIMPSE stands for GLobal IMPlicit SEarch. While many text indexing schemes create quite large indexes (usually around 50% of the size of the original text), a GLIMPSE-created index is only 2-4% of the size of the original text.\n\nGLIMPSE uses and takes a great deal of inspiration from [[Agrep]], which was also developed at the University of Arizona, but GLIMPSE uses a high level index whereas Agrep parses all the text each time.\n\nThe basic algorithm is similar to other text indexing and retrieval engines, except that the text records in the index are huge, consisting of multiple files each. This index is searched using a boolean matching algorithm like most other text indexing and retrieval engines. After one or more of these large text records is matched, Agrep is used to actually scan for the exact text desired. While this is slower than traditional totally indexed approaches, the advantage of the smaller index is seen to be advantageous to the individual user. This approach would not work particularly well across websites, but it would work reasonably well for a single site, or a single workstation. In addition, the smaller index can be created more quickly than a full index.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://webglimpse.net/ Glimpse and WebGlimpse home page]\n*[http://webglimpse.net/pubs/glimpse.pdf Original Glimpse paper] (PDF)\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Free search engine software]]\n[[Category:Search engine software]]"

S'{{cleanup|date=November 2010}}{{External links|date=January 2012}}\n\n\'\'\'Expertise finding\'\'\' is the use of tools for finding and assessing individual [[expertise]], with particular focus on scientific expertise.\n\n== Importance of expertise ==\n\nIt can be argued that human expertise is more valuable than capital, means of production or intellectual property. Contrary to expertise, all other aspects of capitalism are now relatively generic: access to capital is global, as is access to means of production for many areas of manufacturing.  [[Intellectual property]] can be similarly licensed.  Furthermore, expertise finding is also a key aspect of [[institutional memory]], as without its experts an institution is effectively decapitated.  However, finding and \xe2\x80\x9clicensing\xe2\x80\x9d expertise, the key to the effective use of these resources, remain much harder, starting with the very first step: finding expertise that you can trust.\n\nUntil very recently, finding expertise required a mix of individual, social and collaborative practices, a haphazard process at best.  Mostly, it involved contacting individuals one trusts and asking them for referrals, while hoping that one\xe2\x80\x99s judgment about those individuals is justified and that their answers are thoughtful.\n\nIn the last fifteen years, a class of [[knowledge management]] software has emerged to facilitate and improve the quality of expertise finding, termed \xe2\x80\x9cexpertise locating systems\xe2\x80\x9d.  These software range from [[Social network service|social networking systems]] to [[knowledge base]]s.  Some software, like those in the social networking realm, rely on users to connect each other, thus using social filtering to act as [[Recommender system|\xe2\x80\x9crecommender systems\xe2\x80\x9d]].\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are specialized [[knowledge base]]s that rely on experts to populate a specialized type of [[database]] with their self-determined areas of expertise and contributions, and do not rely on user recommendations.  Hybrids that feature expert-populated content in conjunction with user recommendations also exist, and are arguably more valuable for doing so.\n\nStill other expertise knowledge bases rely strictly on external manifestations of expertise, herein termed \xe2\x80\x9cgated objects\xe2\x80\x9d, e.g., [[citation impact]]s for scientific papers or [[data mining]] approaches wherein many of the work products of an expert are collated.  Such systems are more likely to be free of user-introduced biases (e.g., [http://researchscorecard.com/ ResearchScorecard] ), though the use of computational methods can introduce other biases.\n\nExamples of the systems outlined above are listed in Table 1.\n\n\'\'\'Table 1: A classification of expertise location systems\'\'\'\n\n{| class="wikitable" border="1"\n|-\n!

This problem grows even more acute with increasing ignorance on the part of the non-expert due to typical search problems involving use of keywords to search unstructured data that are not semantically normalized, as well as variability in how well an expert has set up their descriptive content pages.  Improved question matching is one reason why third-party semantically normalized systems such as [http://researchscorecard.com ResearchScorecard] and [[BiomedExperts]] should be able to provide better answers to queries from non-expert users.\n* Avoiding expert-fatigue due to too many questions/requests from users of the system (ref. 1).\n* Finding ways to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d of the system to reap unjustified expertise [[credibility]].\n\n== Expertise ranking ==\n\nMeans of classifying and ranking expertise (and therefore experts) become essential if the number of experts returned by a query is greater than a handful.  This raises the following social problems associated with such systems:\n\n* How can expertise be assessed objectively? Is that even possible?\n* What are the consequences of relying on unstructured social assessments of expertise, such as user recommendations?\n* How does one distinguish [[Authority|\'\'authoritativeness\'\']] as a proxy metric of expertise from simple \'\'popularity\'\', which is often a function of one\'s ability to express oneself coupled with a good social sense?\n* What are the potential consequences of the social or professional stigma associated with the use of an authority ranking, such as used in [http://technorati.com Technorati] and [http://researchscorecard.com ResearchScorecard])?\n\n== Sources of data for assessing expertise ==\nMany types of data sources have been used to infer expertise.  They can be broadly categorized based on whether they measure "raw" contributions provided by the expert, or whether some sort of filter is applied to these contributions.\n\nUnfiltered data sources that have been used to assess expertise, in no particular ranking order:\n\n* user recommendations\n* help desk tickets: what the problem was and who fixed it\n* e-mail traffic between users\n* documents, whether private or on the web, particularly publications\n* user-maintained web pages\n* reports (technical, marketing, etc.)\n\nFiltered data sources, that is, contributions that require approval by third parties (grant committees, referees, patent office, etc.) are particularly valuable for measuring expertise in a way that minimizes biases that follow from popularity or other social factors:\n\n* [[patent]]s, particularly if issued\n* scientific publications\n* issued grants (failed grant proposals are rarely know beyond the authors)\n* [[clinical trial]]s\n* product launches\n* pharmaceutical drugs\n\n== Approaches for creating expertise content ==\n* Manual, either by experts themselves (e.g., LinkedIn) or by a curator\n* Automated, e.g., using [[software agent]]s (e.g., MIT\'s [http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/Expert-Finder/Expert-Finder-Intro.html ExpertFinder] and the [http://wiki.foaf-project.org/ExpertFinder ExpertFinder] initiative) or a combination of agents and human curation (e.g., [http://researchscorecard.com/ ResearchScorecard])\n\n== Interesting expertise systems over the years ==\nIn no particular order...\n\n* Autonomy\'s IDOL\n* AskMe\n* Tacit Knowledge Systems\' ActiveNet\n* Triviumsoft\'s SEE-K\n* MIT\xe2\x80\x99s [http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/Expert-Finder/Expert-Finder-Intro.html ExpertFinder] (ref 3)\n* MITRE\xe2\x80\x99s (ref 1) [http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/third.html Expert Finder]\n* MITRE\xe2\x80\x99s XpertNet\n* Arnetminer (ref 2)\n* Dataware II Knowledge Directory\n* Thomson\xe2\x80\x99s tool\n* Hewlett-Packard\xe2\x80\x99s CONNEX\n* Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s SPUD project\n* [http://www.xperscore.com Xperscore]\n* [http://intunex.fi/skillhive/ Skillhive]\n\n== Conferences ==\n# [http://expertfinder.info/pickme2008 The ExpertFinder Initiative]\n\n== References ==\n\n# Ackerman, Mark and McDonald, David (1998) "Just Talk to Me: A Field Study of Expertise Location" \'\'Proceedings of the 1998 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work\'\'.\n# Hughes, Gareth and Crowder, Richard (2003) "Experiences in designing highly adaptable expertise finder systems"  \'\'Proceedings of the DETC Conference 2003\'\'.\n# Maybury, M., D\xe2\x80\x99Amore, R., House, D.

S"{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}\nA '''communication engine''' is a tool that sends user requests to several other [[communication protocols]] and/or [[database]]s and aggregates the results into a single list or displays them according to their source. Communication engines enable users to enter communication account authorization once and access several communication avenues simultaneously. Communication engines operate on the premise that the [[World Wide Web]] is too large for any one engine to index it all and that more productive results can be obtained by combining the results from several engines dynamically. This may save the user from having to use multiple engines separately.\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Computing terminology]]\n\n\n{{Web-stub}}"

S'An \'\'\'index term\'\'\', \'\'\'subject term\'\'\', \'\'\'subject heading\'\'\', or \'\'\'descriptor\'\'\', in [[information retrieval]], is a term that captures the essence of the topic of a document. Index terms make up a [[controlled vocabulary]] for use in [[bibliographic record]]s. They are an integral part of bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and disseminate documents. They are used as keywords to retrieve documents in an information system, for instance, a catalog or a [[search engine]].  A popular form of keywords on the web are [[tag (metadata)|tags]] which are directly visible and can be assigned by non-experts also. Index terms can consist of a word, phrase, or alphanumerical term. They are created by analyzing the document either manually with [[subject indexing]] or automatically with [[Index (search engine)|automatic indexing]] or more sophisticated methods of keyword extraction. Index terms can either come from a controlled vocabulary or be freely assigned.\n\nKeywords are stored in a [[Index (search engine)|search index]]. Common words like [[article (grammar)|articles]] (a, an, the) and conjunctions (and, or, but) are not treated as keywords because it is inefficient to do so. Almost every English-language site on the Internet has the article "\'\'the\'\'", and so it makes no sense to search for it. The most popular search engine, [[Google]] removed [[stop words]] such as "the" and "a" from its indexes for several years, but then re-introduced them, making certain types of precise search possible again.\n\nThe term "descriptor" was coined by [[Calvin Mooers]] in 1948. It is in particular used about a preferred term from a [[thesaurus]]. \n\nThe [[Simple Knowledge Organisation System]] language (SKOS) provides a way to express index terms with [[Resource Description Framework]] for use in the context of [[Semantic Web]].\n\n==Author keywords==\nMany journals and databases provides access (also) to index terms made by authors to the articles being published or represented. The relative quality of indexer-provided index terms and author provided index terms is of interest to research in information retrieval. The quality of both kinds of indexing terms depends, of course, on the qualifications of provider. In general authors have difficulties providing indexing terms that characterizes his document \'\'relative\'\' to the other documents in the database. Author keywords are an integral part of literature.\n\n==Examples==\n*[[Canadian Subject Headings]] (CSH)\n*[[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH)\n*[[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH)\n*[[Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System]] (PSH)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dynamic keyword insertion]]\n<!-- *Key-objects -->\n*[[Keyword cloud]]\n*[[Keyword density]]\n*[[Keyword optimization]]\n*[[knowledge tags|Keyword tagging]]\n*[[Subject (documents)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commonscat|Information retrieval}}\n*{{cite book|last=Svenonius|first=Elaine|author-link=Elaine Svenonius|title=The intellectual foundation of information organization|date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262512619|edition=1st MIT Press pbk.}}\n\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n\n{{Library-stub}}'

Indexing Service is still included with Windows Server 2008 but is not installed or running by default.<ref name="WIS-Install2008" />\n\nIndexing Service has been deprecated in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deprecated Features for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee681698%28WS.10%29.aspx|work=Windows 7 Technical Library|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=8 November 2011|location=Indexing Service|date=October 16, 2009}}</ref> It has been removed from [[Windows 8]].\n\n== Search interfaces ==\n\nComprehensive searching is available after initial building of the index, which can take up to hours or days, depending on the size of the specified directories, the speed of the hard drive, user activity, indexer settings and other factors. Searching using Indexing service works also on [[Uniform Naming Convention|UNC]] paths and/or mapped network drives if the sharing server indexes appropriate directory and is aware of its sharing.\n\nOnce the indexing service has been turned on and has built its index it can be searched in three ways. The search option available from the [[Start Menu]] on the [[Microsoft windows|Windows]] [[Taskbar]] will use the indexing service if it is enabled and will even accept complex queries. Queries can also be performed using either the \'\'Indexing Service Query Form\'\' in the [[Microsoft Management Console#Common snap-ins|Computer Management snap-in]] of Microsoft Management Console, or, alternatively, using third-party applications such as \'Aim at File\' or \'Grokker Desktop\'.\n\nMicrosoft Index Server 2.0 does not detect changes to a catalog if the data is located on a [[Volume Mount Point|mounted partition]].

S'\'\'\'Social search\'\'\' or a \'\'\'social search engine\'\'\' is a type of [[web search]] that takes into account the [[Social Graph]] of the person initiating the search query. When applied to web searches the Social-Graph uses established algorithmic or machine-based approaches where relevance is determined by analyzing the text of each document or the link structure of the documents.<ref>[http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3623153 What\'s the Big Deal With Social Search?], SearchEngineWatch, Aug 15, 2006</ref> Search results produced by \'\'\'social search engine\'\'\' give more visibility to content created or "touched" by users in the Social Graph.\n\nSocial search takes many forms, ranging from simple [[social bookmarking|shared bookmarks]] or [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] of content with descriptive labels to more sophisticated approaches that combine human intelligence with computer [[algorithm]]s.<ref>[http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MC.2009.87 Chi, Ed H.

Example forms of user input include social bookmarking or direct interaction with the search results such as promoting or demoting results the user feels are more or less relevant to their query.<ref>[http://venturebeat.com/2008/01/31/googles-marissa-mayer-social-search-is-the-future Google\xe2\x80\x99s Marissa Mayer: Social search is the future], VentureBeat, Jan 31, 2008</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe term social search began to emerge between 2004 and 2005. The concept of social ranking can be considered to derive from Google\'s [[PageRank]] algorithm,{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} which assigns importance to web pages based on analysis of the link structure of the web, because PageRank is relying on the collective judgment of webmasters linking to other content on the web. Links, in essence, are positive votes by the webmaster community for their favorite sites.\n\nIn 2008, there were a few startup companies that focused on ranking search results according to one\'s [[social graph]] on [[social networks]].<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB121063460767286631.html New Sites Make It Easier To Spy on Your Friends], Wall Street Journal, May 13. 2008</ref><ref>[http://mashable.com/2007/08/27/social-search/ Social Search Guide: 40+ Social Search Engines], Mashable, Aug 27. 2007</ref> Companies in the social search space include  Evam-SOCOTO Wajam, Slangwho, [[Sproose]], [[Mahalo.com|Mahalo]], [[Jumper 2.0]], [[Qitera]], [[Scour Inc.|Scour]], [[Wink Technologies|Wink]], [[Eurekster]], [[Baynote]], [[Delver (Social Search)|Delver]], and OneRiot. Former efforts include [[Wikia Search]]. In 2008, a story on \'\'[[TechCrunch]]\'\' showed [[Google]] potentially adding in a voting mechanism to search results similar to [[Digg]]\'s methodology.<ref>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/16/is-this-the-future-of-search/ Is This The Future Of Search?], TechCrunch, July 16, 2008</ref> This suggests growing interest in how social groups can influence and potentially enhance the ability of algorithms to find meaningful data for end users. There are also other services like Sentiment that turn search personal by searching within the users\' social circles.\n\nIn October 2009, [[Google]] rolled out its "Social Search" feature; after a time in [[beta]], the feature was expanded to multiple languages in May 2011. Before the expansion however in 2010 [[Bing]] and [[Google]] were already taking into account re-tweets and Likes when providing search results.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.marchpr.com/blog/2013/04/seo-social-media-search/|title = Retweets and Likes influencing search results|date = 10 April 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014| publisher = March Communications}}</ref> However, after a search deal with Twitter ended without renewal, Google began to retool its Social Search. In January 2012, Google released "Search plus Your World", a further development of Social Search. The feature, which is integrated into Google\'s regular search as an opt-out feature, pulls references to results from [[Google+]] profiles. The goal was to deliver better, more relevant and personalized search results with this integration. This integration however had some problems in which [[Google+]] still isn\'t wildly adopted or has much usage among many users.<ref name="HubSpot">{{cite web|url = https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34058/Facebook-Announces-New-Social-Search-Feature-Called-Graph-Search.aspx|title = Facebook Announces New Social Search Feature|date = 15 January 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014| publisher = HubSpot}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, [[Facebook]] announced a new search engine called [[Graph Search]] still in the beta stages. The goal in mind was to accomplish what [[Google]] failed at, skipping the results that are popular to the internet, in favor of the results that are popular within your social circle. Unlike [[Google]], [[Facebook]]\'s Graph search differed in two large areas, first, people use Facebook frequently. This allows [[Facebook]] to use all it\'s user generated content that is uploaded everyday to improve the [[Facebook]] search experience.<ref name="HubSpot"/> Secondly, [[Facebook]] did not incorporate Google into Facebook search, instead Graph Search is powered by [[Bing]].This allows [[Bing]] results to show when Facebook\'s Graph Search can\'t find a match.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/01/15/live-facebook-announces-graph-search/|title = Graph Search powered by Bing|date = 15 January 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014| publisher = Forbes}}</ref>\n\n==Concerns==\n\nWhen Google announced "Search plus Your World" the reaction was mixed among tech companies. The company was subsequently criticized by [[Twitter]] for the perceived potential impact of "Search plus Your World" upon web publishers, describing the feature\'s release to the public as a "bad day for the web", while Google replied that Twitter refused to allow deep search crawling by Google of Twitter\'s content.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cnbc.com/id/100381337#.|title = Twitter unhappy about Google\'s social search changes|date = 11 January 2012|accessdate = 11 January 2012|publisher = BBC News}}</ref> The criticism from [[Twitter]] wasn\'t without merits however, by [[Google]] integrating [[Google+]], they were essentially forcing people to switch from a social network on to theirs in order to improve search results. One famous example occurred when [[Google]] showed a link to Mark Zuckerberg\'s dormant [[Google+]] account rather than the active [[Facebook]] profile.<ref name="Google pushing Google">{{cite web|url = http://searchengineland.com/googles-knowledge-graph-finally-shows-social-networks-named-google-209171.|title = Google pushing Google+|date = 18 November 2014|accessdate = 1 December 2012|publisher = Third Door Media}}</ref> Further more this affected businesses in which if they do not have time to leverage all other social media sites, they knew they should use [[Google+]] to maximize their efforts since the data shows it impacts rankings more than [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/01/31/how-social-signals-impact-search-engine-rankings/#.|title = Google+ impacts ranking more|date = 31 January 2014|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = Quick Sprout}}</ref> in November 2014 these accusations started to die down because Google\'s Knowledge Graph started to finally show links to [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other social media sites.<ref name="Google pushing Google"/>\n\n[[Google]] was not the only one that garnished concerns over social search. After the introduction of [[Graph Search]] by [[Facebook]] many pointed out how [[Graph Search]] showed private information that isn\'t in web search.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/01/15/live-facebook-announces-graph-search/|title = Graph Search results|date = 1 January 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = Forbes}}</ref> Information that was once obscure is now easier to dig up, which is why Facebook urges users to monitor post and pictures users are tagged in and filter and filter any content that users would not want to make public.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2013/01/15/facebooks-new-social-search-what-it-is-and-how-it-affects-your-privacy/|title = Graph Search Privacy Concerns|date = 15 January 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = Forbes}}</ref>\n\nThis in large points towards the biggest concern toward social search which is that social media networks don\'t have a vested interest in working with search engines. [[LinkedIn]] for example has taken steps to improve its own individual search functions in order to stray users from external search engines. Even [[Microsoft]] started working with [[Twitter]] in order to integrate some tweets into [[Bing]]\'s search results in November 2013. Yet [[Twitter]] has its own search engine which points out how much value their data has and why they\'d like to keep it in house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/30/microsoft-and-twitter-make-bing-a-better-social-search-engine/|title = Bing\'s twitter integration|date = 30 June 2014|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = Venture Beat}}</ref> In the end though social search will never be truly comprehensive of the subjects that matter to people unless users opt to be completely public with their information.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34058/Facebook-Announces-New-Social-Search-Feature-Called-Graph-Search.aspx|title = User data will never be competently public|date = 15 January 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = HubSpot}}</ref>\n\n==Social discovery==\nSocial discovery is the use of social preferences and personal information to predict what content will be desirable to the user.<ref name="Bailyn2012">{{cite book|last=Bailyn|first=Evan|title=Outsmarting Social Media: Profiting in the Age of Friendship Marketing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M97RiODwKHEC&pg=PT51|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=2012-04-12|publisher=Que Publishing|isbn=9780132861403|pages=51\xe2\x80\x93}}</ref> Technology is used to discover new people and sometimes new experiences shopping, meeting friends or even traveling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Amy|url=http://mashable.com/2013/07/08/social-discovery-apps/|publisher=Mashable|title=Are Social Discovery Apps Too Creepy?}}</ref>  The discovery of new people is often in real-time, enabled by [[mobile apps]]. However, social discovery is not limited to meeting people in real-time, it also leads to sales and revenue for companies via social media.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cubie|first=Gregor|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/10/02/social-discovery-sites-influence-retail-expanding-rakutens-playcom-numbers-find|publisher=The Drum|title=Social Discovery sites\' influence on retail expanding}}</ref>  An example of retail would be the addition of social sharing with music, through the iTunes music store. There is a social component to discovering new music <ref>{{cite web|last=Constine|first=Josh|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/bitcovery/|publisher=TechCrunch|title=Bitcovery Brings A Desperately Needed Social Discovery Layer To The iTunes Store}}</ref> Social discovery is at the basis of [[Facebook]]\'s profitability, generating ad revenue by targeting the ads to users using the social connections to enhance the commercial appeal.<ref name="Bailyn2012"/>\n\n==Developments==\n\n[[Google]] may be falling behind in terms of social search, but in reality they see the potential and importance of this technology with [[Web 3.0]] and [[web semantics]]. The importance of social media lies within how Semantic search works. Semantic search understands much more, including where you are, the time of day, your past history, and many other factors including social connections, and social signals. The first step in order to achieve this will be to teach algorithms to understand the relationship between things.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/google-semantic-search|title = Google Semantic Search|date = 28 February 2014|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = Social Media Today}}</ref>\n\nHowever this is not possible unless social media sites decide to work with search engines, which is difficult since everyone would like to be the main toll bridge to the internet. As we continue on, and more articles are referred by social media sites, the main concern becomes what good is a search engine without the data of users.\n\nOne development that seeks to redefine search is the combination of [[distributed search]] with social search. The goal is a basic search service whose operation is controlled and maintained by the community itself. This would largely work like Peer to Peer networks in which users provide the data they seems appropriate. Since the data used by search engines belongs to the user they should have absolute control over it. The infrastructure required for a search engine is already available in the from of thousands of idle desktops and extensive residential broadband access.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www2009.eprints.org/242/|title = Towards Distributed Social Search Engines|accessdate = 1 December 2014|publisher = EPrints}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative filtering]]\n* [[Enterprise bookmarking]]\n* [[Human search engine]]\n* [[Relevance feedback]]\n* [[Social software]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Internet search}}\n\n[[Category:Searching]]\n[[Category:Social search| ]]\n[[Category:Social software|Search]]'

S'The \'\'\'European Summer School in Information Retrieval\'\'\' (ESSIR) is a scientific event founded in 1990, which starts off a series of Summer Schools to provide high quality teaching of information retrieval on advanced topics. ESSIR is typically a week-long event consisting of guest lectures and seminars from invited lecturers who are recognized experts in the field.\nThe aim of ESSIR is to give to its participants a common ground in different aspects of \'\'\'[[Information Retrieval]] (IR)\'\'\'. Maristella Agosti in 2008 stated that: \xe2\x80\x9c\'\'The term IR identifies the activities that a person \xe2\x80\x93 the user \xe2\x80\x93 has to conduct to choose, from a collection of documents, those that can be of interest to him to satisfy a specific and contingent information need.\'\'\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>Agosti, M.: \xe2\x80\x9cInformation Access using the Guide of User Requirements\xe2\x80\x9d. In: \'\'Information Access through Search Engines and Digital Libraries\'\'. Agosti, M. ed., Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 1-12, (2008).</ref>\n\nIR is a discipline with many facets and at the same time influences and is influenced by many other scientific disciplines. Indeed, IR ranges from [[Computer Science]] to [[Information Science]] and beyond; moreover, a large number of IR methods and techniques are adopted and absorbed by several technologies. The IR core methods and techniques are those for designing and developing IR systems, Web search engines, and tools for information storing and querying in Digital Libraries. IR core subjects are: system architectures, algorithms, formal theoretical models, and evaluation of the diverse systems and services that implement functionalities of storing and retrieving documents from multimedia document collections, and over wide area networks such as the [[Internet]].\n\nESSIR aims to give a deep and authoritative insight of the core IR methods and subjects along these three dimensions and also for this reason it is intended for researchers starting out in IR, for industrialists who wish to know more about this increasingly important topic and for people working on topics related to management of information on the [[Internet]].\n\nTwo books have been prepared as readings in IR from editions of ESSIR, the first one is \'\'Lectures on Information Retrieval\'\'\n,<ref>Agosti, M., Crestani, F. and Pasi, G.

S'{{other uses}}\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2013}}\n{{lowercase|title=find}} \nIn [[Unix-like]] and some other [[operating system]]s, <code>\'\'\'find\'\'\'</code> is a [[command-line utility]] that [[Search engine (computing)|searches]] through one or more [[directory tree]]s of a [[file system]], locates [[Computer file|file]]s based on some [[user (computing)|user]]-specified criteria and applies a user-specified action on each matched file. The possible search criteria include a [[pattern matching|pattern]] to match against the [[file name]] or a time range to match against the modification time or access time of the file. By default, <code>find</code> returns a list of all files below the current [[working directory]].\n\nThe related <code>[[locate (Unix)|locate]]</code> programs use a database of indexed files obtained through <code>find</code> (updated at regular intervals, typically by <code>[[cron]]</code> job) to provide a faster method of searching the entire filesystem for files by name.\n\n==History==\n<code>find</code> appeared in [[Version 5 Unix]] as part of the [[PWB/UNIX|Programmer\'s Workbench]] project.<ref name="reader">{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer\'s Manual, 1971\xe2\x80\x931986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}</ref>\n\n== Find syntax ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2008}}\n\n<code>find [-H] [-L] [-P] path... [expression]</code>\n\nThe three options control how the <code>find</code> command should treat symbolic links. The default behaviour is never to follow symbolic links. This can be explicitly specified using the -P flag. The -L flag will cause the <code>find</code> command to follow symbolic links. The -H flag will only follow symbolic links while processing the command line arguments. These flags are not available with some older versions of <code>find</code>.\n\nAt least one path must precede the expression. <code>find</code> is capable of interpreting [[Wildcard character|wildcards]] internally and commands must be constructed carefully in order to control [[Glob (programming)|shell globbing]].\n\nExpression elements are whitespace-separated and evaluated from left to right.  They can contain logical elements such as AND (&#x2011;and or &#x2011;a) and OR (&#x2011;or &#x2011;o) as well as more complex predicates.\n\nThe [[GNU Find Utilities|GNU]] <code>find</code> has a large number of additional features not specified by POSIX.\n\n== POSIX protection from infinite output ==\n\nReal-world filesystems often contain looped structures created through the use of [[hard link|hard]] or [[symbolic link|soft links]].  The [[POSIX|POSIX standard]] requires that\n{{Quotation|\nThe <code>find</code> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited\ndirectory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered. When it detects an infinite\nloop, <code>find</code> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover\nits position in the hierarchy or terminate.\n}}\n\n==Operators ==\nOperators can be used to enhance the expressions of the find command. Operators are listed in order of decreasing precedence:\n\n*\'\'\'( expr )\'\'\' Force precedence. \n*\'\'\'! expr\'\'\' True if expr is false.\n*\'\'\'expr1 expr2\'\'\' And (implied); expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false. \n*\'\'\'expr1 -a expr2\'\'\' Same as expr1 expr2.  \n*\'\'\'expr1 -o expr2\'\'\' Or; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is true.\n\n find . -name \'fileA_*\' -o -name \'fileB_*\'\n\nThis command searches files whose name has a prefix of "fileA_" or "fileB_" in the current directory.\n\n find . -name \'foo.cpp\' \'!\' -path \'.svn\'\n\nThis command searches for files with the name "foo.cpp" in all subdirectories of the current directory (current directory itself included) other than ".svn".   We quote the ! so that it\'s not interpreted by the shell as the history substitution character.\n\n==Type filter explanation==\n\n\'\'\'-type\'\'\' \'\'option used to specify search for only file, link or directory.\'\'\nVarious type filters are supported by find. They are activated using the\n\n find -type c\n\nconfiguration switch where c may be any of:\n* \'\'\'b \'\'\'[[Device file|block (buffered) special]]\n* \'\'\'c \'\'\'[[Device file|character (unbuffered special)]]\n* \'\'\'d [[Directory (computing)|directory]]\'\'\'\n* \'\'\'p \'\'\'[[Named pipe|named pipe (FIFO)]]\n* \'\'\'f [[regular file]]\'\'\'\n* \'\'\'l \'\'\'[[symbolic link]]; this is never true if the -L option or the -follow option is in effect, unless the symbolic link is broken. If you want to search for symbolic links when -L is in effect, use -xtype (though that is a GNU extension).\n* \'\'\'s \'\'\'[[Unix domain socket|socket]]\n* \'\'\'D \'\'\'[[Doors (computing)|door (Solaris)]]\n\nThe configuration switches listed in bold are most commonly used.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===From current directory===\n find . -name \'my*\'\n\nThis searches in the current directory (represented by the dot character) and below it, for files and directories with names starting with \'\'my\'\'. The quotes avoid the [[shell (computing)|shell]] expansion \xe2\x80\x94 without them the shell would replace \'\'my*\'\' with the list of files whose names begin with \'\'my\'\' in the current directory. In newer versions of the program, the directory may be omitted, and it will imply the current directory.\n\n===Files only===\n find . -name \'my*\' -type f\nThis limits the results of the above search to only regular files, therefore excluding directories, special files, pipes, symbolic links, etc. \'\'my*\'\' is enclosed in single quotes (apostrophes) as otherwise the shell would replace it with the list of  files in the current directory starting with \'\'my\'\'......\n\n===Commands===\nThe previous examples created listings of results because, by default, <code>find</code> executes the \'-print\' action.   (Note that early versions of the <code>find</code> command had no default action at all; therefore the resulting list of files would be discarded, to the bewilderment of users.)\n\n find . -name \'my*\' -type f -ls\nThis prints extended file information.\n\n===Search all directories===\n find / -name myfile -type f -print\nThis searches every file on the computer for a file with the name \'\'myfile\'\' and prints it to the screen. It is generally not a good idea to look for data files this way.  This can take a considerable amount of time, so it is best to specify the directory more precisely.  Some operating systems may mount dynamic filesystems that are not congenial to <code>find</code>.   More complex filenames including characters special to the shell may need to be enclosed in single quotes.\n\n===Search all but one directory subtree===\n find / -path excluded_path -prune -o -type f -name myfile -print\nThis searches every folder on the computer except the subtree \'\'excluded_path\'\' (full path including the leading /), for a file with the name \'\'myfile\'\'.  It will not detect directories, devices, links, doors, or other "special" filetypes.\n\n===Specify a directory===\n find /home/weedly -name \'myfile\' -type f -print\nThis searches for files named \'\'myfile\'\' in the \'\'/home/weedly\'\' directory, the home directory for userid \'\'weedly\'\'.  You should always specify the directory to the deepest level you can remember.  The quotes are optional in this example because "myfile" contains no characters special to the shell.\n\n===Search several directories===\n find local /tmp -name mydir -type d -print\nThis searches for directories named \'\'mydir\'\' in the \'\'local\'\' subdirectory of the current working directory and the \'\'/tmp\'\' directory.\n\n===Ignore errors===\nIf you\'re doing this as a user other than root, you might want to ignore permission denied (and any other) errors.  Since errors are printed to [[stderr]], they can be suppressed by redirecting the output to /dev/null.  The following example shows how to do this in the bash shell: \n find / -name \'myfile\' -type f -print 2>/dev/null\n\nIf you are a [[C shell|csh]] or [[tcsh]] user, you cannot redirect [[stderr]] without redirecting [[stdout]] as well.  You can use sh to run the <code>find</code> command to get around this:\n sh -c find / -name \'myfile\' -type f -print 2>/dev/null\n\nAn alternate method when using [[C shell|csh]] or [[tcsh]] is to pipe the output from [[stdout]] and [[stderr]] into a [[grep]] command. This example shows how to suppress lines that contain permission denied errors.\n find . -name \'myfile\' |& grep -v \'Permission denied\'\n\n===Find any one of differently named files===\n find . \\( -name \'*jsp\' -o -name \'*java\' \\) -type f -ls\n\nThe <code>-ls</code> option prints extended information, and the example finds any file whose name ends with either \'jsp\' or \'java\'. Note that the parentheses are required. Also note that the operator "or" can be abbreviated as "o". The "and" operator is assumed where no operator is given.  In many shells the parentheses must be escaped with a backslash, "\\(" and "\\)", to prevent them from being interpreted as special shell characters. The <code>-ls</code> option and the <code>-or</code> operator are not available on all versions of <code>find</code>.\n\n===Execute an action===\n find /var/ftp/mp3 -name \'*.mp3\' -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\nThis command changes the [[File system permissions|permissions]] of all files with a name ending in \'\'.mp3\'\' in the directory \'\'/var/ftp/mp3\'\'. The  action is carried out by specifying the option <code>-exec [[chmod]] 644 {} \\;</code> in the command. For every file whose name ends in <code>.mp3</code>, the command <code>chmod 644 {}</code> is executed replacing <code>{}</code> with the name of the file. The semicolon (backslashed to avoid the shell interpreting it as a command separator) indicates the end of the command. Permission <code>644</code>, usually shown as <code>rw-r--r--</code>, gives the file owner full permission to read and write the file, while other users have read-only access. In some shells, the <code>{}</code> must be quoted.  The trailing ";" is customarily quoted with a leading "\\", but could just as effectively be enclosed in single quotes.\n\nNote that the command itself should *not* be quoted; otherwise you get error messages like\n\n find: echo "mv ./3bfn rel071204": No such file or directory\n\nwhich means that <code>find</code> is trying to run a file called \'echo "mv ./3bfn rel071204"\' and failing.\n\nIf you will be executing over many results, it is more efficient to use a variant of the exec primary that collects filenames up to ARG_MAX and then executes COMMAND with a list of filenames.\n\n find . -exec COMMAND {} +\n\nThis will ensure that filenames with whitespaces are passed to the executed COMMAND without being split up by the shell.\n\n===Delete files and directories===\n\'\'\'Caveats\'\'\': the -delete action is a GNU extension, and using it turns on -depth.   So, if you are testing a find command with -print instead of -delete in order to figure out what will happen before going for it, you need to use -depth -print.\n\nDelete empty files and directories and print the names (note that -empty is a vendor unique extension from GNU find that may not be available in all find implementations)\n find /foo -empty -delete -print\n\nDelete empty files\n find /foo -type f -empty -delete\n\nDelete empty directories\n find /foo -type d -empty -delete\n\nDelete files and directories (if empty) named <code>bad</code> \n find /foo -name bad -empty -delete\n\n\'\'\'Warning\'\'\': <code>-delete</code> should be used with other operators such as\n<code>-empty</code> or <code>-name</code>.\n\n find /foo -delete  # this deletes \'\'\'all\'\'\' in /foo\n\n===Search for a string===\nThis command will search for a string in all files from the /tmp directory and below:\n<source lang="bash">\n $ find /tmp -type f -exec grep \'search string\' \'{}\' /dev/null \\+\n</source>\nThe <tt>[[/dev/null]]</tt> argument is used to show the name of the file before the text that is found. Without it, only the text found is printed.  An equivalent mechanism is to use the "-H" or "--with-filename" option to grep:\n<source lang="bash">\n $ find /tmp -type f -exec grep -H \'search string\' \'{}\' \'+\' \n</source>\nGNU grep can be used on its own to perform this task:\n\n $ grep -r \'search string\' /tmp\n\nExample of search for "LOG" in jsmith\'s home directory\n<source lang="bash" highlight="1">\n $ find ~jsmith -exec grep LOG \'{}\' /dev/null \\; -print\n /home/jsmith/scripts/errpt.sh:cp $LOG $FIXEDLOGNAME\n /home/jsmith/scripts/errpt.sh:cat $LOG\n /home/jsmith/scripts/title:USER=$LOGNAME\n</source>\nExample of search for the string "ERROR" in all XML files in the current directory and all sub-directories\n<source lang="bash">\n\n $ find . -name "*.xml" -exec grep "ERROR" /dev/null \'{}\' \\+ \n</source>\nThe double quotes (" ") surrounding the search string and single quotes (<nowiki>\' \'</nowiki>) surrounding the braces are optional in this example, but needed to allow spaces and some other special characters in the string.  Note with more complex text (notably in most popular shells descended from `sh` and `csh`) single quotes are often the easier choice, since \'\'\'double quotes do not prevent all special interpretation\'\'\'. Quoting filenames which have English contractions demonstrates how this can get rather complicated, since a string with an apostrophe in it is easier to protect with double quotes.  Example:\n<source lang="bash">\n\n $ find . -name "file-containing-can\'t" -exec grep "can\'t" \'{}\' \\; -print\n</source>\n\n===Search for all files owned by a user===\n find . -user <userid>\n\n===Search in case insensitive mode===\nNote that -iname is not in the standard and may not be supported by all implementations.\n\n find . -iname \'\'\'\'MyFile\'\'\'*\'\n\nIf the <code>-iname</code> switch is not supported on your system then workaround techniques may be possible such as:\n\n find . -name \'[m\'\'\'M\'\'\'][\'\'\'y\'\'\'Y][f\'\'\'F\'\'\'][\'\'\'i\'\'\'I][\'\'\'l\'\'\'L][\'\'\'e\'\'\'E]*\'\n\nThis uses [[Perl]] to build the above command for you (though in general this kind of usage is dangerous, since special characters are not properly quoted before being fed into the standard input of `sh`):\n\n echo "\'\'\'\'MyFile\'\'\'*\'" |perl -pe \'s/([a-zA-Z])/[\\L\\1\\U\\1]/g;s/(.*)/find . -name \\1/\'|sh\n\n===Search files by size===\nExample of searching files with size between 100 kilobytes and 500 kilobytes.\n find . -size +100k -a -size -500k\nExample of searching empty files.\n find . -size 0k\nExample of searching non-empty files.\n find . ! -size 0k\n\n===Search files by name and size ===\n \'\'\'find\'\'\' /usr/src {{abbr|!|the negation of the expression that follows}} {{abbr|\\(|the start of a complex expression.}} -name \'*,v\' {{abbr|-o|a logical or of a complex expression. In this case the complex expression is all files like \'*,v\' or \'.*,v\'}} -name \'.*,v\' {{abbr|\\)|the end of a complex expression.}} \'{}\' \\; -print\n\nThis command will search in the /usr/src directory and all sub directories. All files that are of the form \'*,v\' and \'.*,v\' are excluded. Important arguments to note are in the [[tooltip]] that is displayed on mouse-over.\n\n<source lang="bash" enclose="div">\nfor file in `find /opt \\( -name error_log -o -name \'access_log\' -o -name \'ssl_engine_log\' -o -name \'rewrite_log\' -o\n -name \'catalina.out\' \\) -size +300000k -a -size -5000000k`; do \n    cat /dev/null > $file\ndone\n</source>\nThe units should be one of [bckw], \'b\' means 512-byte blocks, \'c\' means byte, \'k\' means kilobytes and \'w\' means 2-byte words. The size does not count indirect blocks, but it does count blocks in sparse files that are not actually allocated.\n\n==Related utilities==\n* <code>[[locate (Unix)|locate]]</code> is a Unix search tool that searches through a prebuilt database of files instead of directory trees of a file system. This is faster than <code>find</code> but less accurate because the database may not be up-to-date.\n* <code>[[grep]]</code> is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression and by default reporting matching lines on [[standard output]].\n* <code>[[tree (Unix)|tree]]</code> is a command-line utility that recursively lists files found in a directory tree, indenting the file names according to their position in the file hierarchy.\n* [[GNU Find Utilities]] (also known as findutils) is a [[GNU package]] which contains implementations of the tools <code>find</code> and [[xargs]].\n* [[BusyBox]] is a utility that provides several stripped-down Unix tools in a single executable file, intended for embedded operating systems with very limited resources.

S"{{multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}\n{{Refimprove|article|date=November 2006}}\n}}\n\n'''Instant indexing''' is a feature offered by [[Internet]] [[search engine]]s that enables users to submit content for immediate inclusion into the [[search engine indexing|index]].\n\n==Delayed inclusion==\nCertain search engine services may require an extended period of time for inclusion, which is seen as a delay and a frustration by [[website]] administrators who wish to have their websites appear in [[search engine results page|search engine results]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.\n\nDelayed inclusion may due to the size of the index that the service must maintain or due to corporate, political or social policies{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Some services only index content collected by a [[web crawling|crawler program]] which does not allow for manual adding of content to index{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.\n\n==Criticisms==\nA criticism of instant indexing is that certain services filter results manually or via algorithms that prevent instant inclusion to avoid inclusion of content that violates the service's policies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nInstant indexing impacts the timeliness of the content included in the index. Given the manner in which many [[web crawling|crawlers]] operate in the case of Internet search engines, websites are only visited if a some other website links to them. Unlinked web sites are never visited (see [[invisible web]]) by the crawler because it cannot reach the website during its traversal. It is assumed that unlinked websites are less authoritative and less popular, and therefore of less quality. Over time, if a website is popular or authoritative, it is assumed that other websites will eventually link to it. If a search engine service provides instant indexing, it bypasses this quality control mechanism by not requiring incoming links. This infers that the search engine's service produces lower quality results.\n\nSelect search services that offer such a service typically also offer [[paid inclusion]], also referred to as [[pay per click|inorganic search]]. This may reduce the quality of search results.\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.web-cite.com/search_marketing/000078.html | title = Don't Blink: Instant Indexing? | publisher = Web-Cite Exposure | date = 2003-03-26 | accessdate = 2006-09-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427184004/http://www.web-cite.com/search_marketing/000078.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-04-27}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.earthstation9.com/index.html?us_searc.htm | title = The Wonderful World of Search Engines and Web Directories \xe2\x80\x94 A Search Engine Guide | author = Stan Daniloski | publisher = Earth Station 9 | date = 2004-09-17 | accessdate = 2006-09-23}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Search engine]]\n* [[Search engine indexing]]\n* [[Web crawling]]\n\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n\n\n{{website-stub}}"

S'Searching by sound for now has limited uses. There are a handful of applications, specifically for mobile devises that utilizes searching by sound. [[Shazam (service)]], [[Soundhound]], Midomi, and others has seen considerable success by using a simple algorithm to match an acoustic fingerprint to a song in a library. These applications takes a sample clip of a song, or a user generated melody and checks a music library to see where the clip matches with the song. From there, song information will be pulled up and displayed to the user. \n\nThese kind of applications is mainly used for finding a song that the user does not already know. \n\nSearching by sound is not limited so just identifying [[songs]], but also for identifying [[melodies]], [[Music|tunes]] or [[advertisements]], [[sound library management]] and [[video files]].\n\n==Acoustic Fingerprinting==\nThe way these apps search by sound is through generating an acoustic fingerprint; a digital summary of the sound. A microphone is used to pick up an audio sample, which is then broken down into a simple numeric signature, a code unique to each track. Using the same method of fingerprinting sounds, when Shazam picks up a sound clip, it will generate a signature for that clip. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s simple pattern matching from there using an extensive audio music database. \n\nThe practice of using [[acoustic fingerprints]] is not limited to just music however, but other areas of the entertainment business as well. Shazam also can identify television shows with the same technique of acoustic fingerprinting. Of course, this method of breaking down a sound sample into a unique signature is useless unless there is an extensive database of music with keys to match with the samples. Shazam has over 11 million songs in its database. <ref> http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2009/10/that_tune_named.html </ref>\n\nOther services such as Midomi and Soundhound allow users to add to that library of music in order to expand the chances to match a sound sample with its corresponding sound. \n\n==Spectogram==\nGenerating a signature from the song is essential for searching by sound, and can be tricky. However, the way certain applications such as Shazam found a way around this issue by creating a spectrogram. \n\nAny piece of music can be translated to a time frequency graph called a spectrogram. For each song in its database, each song is basically a graph that plots the three dimensions of music, frequency vs amplitude (intensity) vs time. The algorithm then picks out the points which peaks in the graph, labeled as \xe2\x80\x9chigher energy content\xe2\x80\x9d. In practice, this seems to work out to about three points per song. <ref> http://www.soyoucode.com/2011/how-does-shazam-recognize-song </ref>\n\nThis is how a song can be identified with just two or three notes. This greatly reduces the impact that [[background noise]] has on searching by sound. The key values taken away from this would be frequency in hertz and time in seconds. Shazam builds their fingerprint catalog out as a hash table, where the key is the frequency. They do not just mark a single point in the spectrogram, rather they mark a pair of points: the \xe2\x80\x9cpeak intensity\xe2\x80\x9d plus a second \xe2\x80\x9canchor point\xe2\x80\x9d. <ref> Li-Chun Wang, Avery. "An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm." Columbia University. Web. 1 Dec. 2014. <http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf>. </ref> So their key is not just a single frequency, it is a hash of the frequencies of both points.  This leads to less hash collisions which in turn speeds up catalog searching by several orders of magnitude by allowing them to take greater advantage of the table\xe2\x80\x99s constant (O(1)) look-up time. <ref> "How Shazam Works." Free Wont. Web. 1 Dec. 2014. <http://laplacian.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/how-shazam-works/>. </ref>\n\nThis method of acoustic fingerprinting allows applications such as Shazam to have the ability to differentiate between two closely related covers, as well as not having to account for popularity of a certain song. \n\n==Query by Humming==\nMidomi and Soundhound both utilize Query by Humming, or QbH. This is a branch off of acoustic fingerprints, but is still a musical retrieval system. After receiving a user generated hummed melody, which is the input query, and returns a ranked list of songs that is closest to the user query. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Searching]]'

S"{{more footnotes|date=August 2014}}\n{{one source|date=August 2014}}\nA '''search engine''' is an [[information retrieval|information retrieval system]] designed to help find information stored on a [[computer system]]. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called ''hits''. Search engines help to minimize the time required to find information and the amount of information which must be consulted, akin to other techniques for managing [[information overload]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nThe most public, visible form of a search engine is a [[Web search engine]] which searches for information on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==How search engines work==\nSearch engines provide an [[interface (computer science)|interface]] to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. The criteria are referred to as a [[search query]]. In the case of text search engines, the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired [[concept]] that one or more [[document]]s may contain.<ref>Voorhees, E.M. [http://www.indexnist.gov/itl/iad/894.02/works/papers/nlp_ir.ps Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval]. National Institute of Standards and Technology. March 2000.</ref> There are several styles of search query [[syntax]] that vary in strictness. It can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites.  Whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]], other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents, pictures, sounds, and various forms of [[natural language]]. Some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as [[query expansion]].\n\n[[Image:search-engine-diagram-en.svg|right|thumb|Index-based search engine]]\n\nThe list of items that meet the criteria specified by the query is typically sorted, or ranked. Ranking items by relevance (from highest to lowest) reduces the time required to find the desired information. [[probability|Probabilistic]] search engines rank items based on measures of [[String metric|similarity]] (between each item and the query, typically on a scale of 1 to 0, 1 being most similar) and sometimes [[popularity]] or [[authority]] (see [[Bibliometrics]]) or use [[relevance feedback]]. [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] search engines typically only return items which match exactly without regard to order, although the term ''boolean search engine'' may simply refer to the use of boolean-style syntax (the use of operators [[Logical_conjunction|AND]], [[Logical_disjunction|OR]], NOT, and [[Exclusive_or|XOR]]) in a probabilistic context.\n\nTo provide a set of matching items that are sorted according to some criteria quickly, a search engine will typically collect [[metadata]] about the group of items under consideration beforehand through a process referred to as [[Index (search engine)|indexing]]. The index typically requires a smaller amount of [[computer storage]], which is why some search engines only store the indexed information and not the full content of each item, and instead provide a method of navigating to the items in the [[serp|search engine result page]]. Alternatively, the search engine may store a copy of each item in a [[cache (computing)|cache]] so that users can see the state of the item at the time it was indexed or for archive purposes or to make repetitive processes work more efficiently and quickly.\n\nOther types of search engines do not store an index. Crawler, or spider type search engines (a.k.a. real-time search engines) may collect and assess items at the time of the search query, dynamically considering additional items based on the contents of a starting item (known as a seed, or seed URL in the case of an Internet crawler). [[Meta search engine]]s store neither an index nor a cache and instead simply reuse the index or results of one or more other search engines to provide an aggregated, final set of results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Automatic summarization]]\n*[[Bibliographic database]]\n*[[Desktop search]]\n*[[Emanuel Goldberg]] (inventor of early search engine)\n*[[Enterprise search]]\n*[[Federated search]]\n*[[Full text search]]\n*[[Human search engine]]\n*[[Image search]]\n*[[Index (search engine)]]\n*[[Inverted index]]\n*[[List of search engines]]\n*[[List of enterprise search vendors]]\n*[[Medical literature retrieval]]\n*[[Metasearch engine]]\n*[[Search engine optimization]]\n*[[Search suggest drop-down list]]\n*[[Selection-based search]]\n*[[Semantic search]]\n* [[Solver (computer science)]]\n*[[Spamdexing]]\n*[[SQL]]\n*[[Text mining]]\n*[[Vertical search]]\n*[[Video search engine]]\n*[[Web search engine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Internet search}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Search Engine (Computing)}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]\n[[Category:Data search engines| Search engine]]"

This order is typically induced by giving a numerical or ordinal score or a binary judgment (e.g. "relevant" or "not relevant") for each item. The ranking model\'s purpose is to rank, i.e. produce a [[permutation]] of items in new, unseen lists in a way which is "similar" to rankings in the training data in some sense.\n\nLearning to rank is a relatively new research area which has emerged in the past decade.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== In information retrieval ===\n[[File:MLR-search-engine-example.png|250px|thumb|A possible architecture of a machine-learned search engine.]]\nRanking is a central part of many [[information retrieval]] problems, such as [[document retrieval]], [[collaborative filtering]], [[sentiment analysis]], [[computational advertising]] (online ad placement).\n\nA possible architecture of a machine-learned search engine is shown in the figure to the right.\n\nTraining data consists of queries and documents matching them together with relevance degree of each match. It may be prepared manually by human \'\'assessors\'\' (or \'\'raters\'\', as [[Google]] calls them),\n<!-- "assessor" is the more standard term, used e.g. by TREC conference -->\nwho check results for some queries and determine [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] of each result.

Often a learning-to-rank problem is reformulated as an optimization problem with respect to one of these metrics.\n\nExamples of ranking quality measures:\n* [[Mean average precision]] (MAP);\n* [[Discounted cumulative gain|DCG]] and [[Normalized discounted cumulative gain|NDCG]];\n* [[Precision (information retrieval)|Precision]]@\'\'n\'\', NDCG@\'\'n\'\', where "@\'\'n\'\'" denotes that the metrics are evaluated only on top \'\'n\'\' documents;\n* [[Mean reciprocal rank]];\n* [[Kendall\'s tau]]\n* [[Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficient|Spearman\'s Rho]]\n\nDCG and its normalized variant NDCG are usually preferred in academic research when multiple levels of relevance are used.<ref>http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276/handouts/lecture15-learning-ranking.ppt</ref> Other metrics such as MAP, MRR and precision, are defined only for binary judgements.\n\nRecently, there have been proposed several new evaluation metrics which claim to model user\'s satisfaction with search results better than the DCG metric:\n* [[Expected reciprocal rank]] (ERR);<ref>{{citation\n|author=Olivier Chapelle, Donald Metzler, Ya Zhang, Pierre Grinspan\n|title=Expected Reciprocal Rank for Graded Relevance\n|url=http://research.yahoo.com/files/err.pdf\n|journal=CIKM\n|year=2009\n|pages=\n}}</ref>\n* [[Yandex]]\'s pfound.<ref>{{citation\n|author=Gulin A., Karpovich P., Raskovalov D., Segalovich I.\n|title=Yandex at ROMIP\'2009: optimization of ranking algorithms by machine learning methods\n|url=http://romip.ru/romip2009/15_yandex.pdf\n|journal=Proceedings of ROMIP\'2009\n|year=2009\n|pages=163\xe2\x80\x93168\n}} (in Russian)</ref>\nBoth of these metrics are based on the assumption that the user is more likely to stop looking at search results after examining a more relevant document, than after a less relevant document.\n\n== Approaches ==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\nTie-Yan Liu of [[Microsoft Research Asia]] in his paper "Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval"<ref name="liu" /> and talks at several leading conferences has analyzed existing algorithms for learning to rank problems and categorized them into three groups by their input representation and [[loss function]]:\n\n=== Pointwise approach ===\nIn this case it is assumed that each query-document pair in the training data has a numerical or ordinal score. Then learning-to-rank problem can be approximated by a regression problem \xe2\x80\x94 given a single query-document pair, predict its score.\n\nA number of existing [[Supervised learning|supervised]] machine learning algorithms can be readily used for this purpose. [[Ordinal regression]] and [[classification (machine learning)|classification]] algorithms can also be used in pointwise approach when they are used to predict score of a single query-document pair, and it takes a small, finite number of values.\n\n=== Pairwise approach ===\nIn this case learning-to-rank problem is approximated by a classification problem \xe2\x80\x94 learning a [[binary classifier]] that can tell which document is better in a given pair of documents. The goal is to minimize average number of [[Permutation#Inversions|inversions]] in ranking.\n\n=== Listwise approach ===\nThese algorithms try to directly optimize the value of one of the above evaluation measures, averaged over all queries in the training data. This is difficult because most evaluation measures are not continuous functions with respect to ranking model\'s parameters, and so continuous approximations or bounds on evaluation measures have to be used.\n\n=== List of methods ===\nA partial list of published learning-to-rank algorithms is shown below with years of first publication of each method:\n:{|class="wikitable sortable"\n!

S'The \'\'\'Jaccard index\'\'\', also known as the \'\'\'Jaccard similarity coefficient\'\'\' (originally coined \'\'coefficient de communaut\xc3\xa9\'\' by [[Paul Jaccard]]), is a [[statistic]] used for comparing the [[Similarity measure|similarity]] and [[diversity index|diversity]] of [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] sets. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] divided by the size of the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the sample sets:\n\n:<math> J(A,B) = {{|A \\cap B|}\\over{|A \\cup B|}}.</math>\n\n(If \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' are both empty, we define \'\'J\'\'(\'\'A\'\',\'\'B\'\')&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.) Clearly, \n:<math> 0\\le J(A,B)\\le 1.</math>\n\nThe [[MinHash]] min-wise independent permutations [[locality sensitive hashing]] scheme may be used to efficiently compute an accurate estimate of the Jaccard similarity coefficient of pairs of sets, where each set is represented by a constant-sized signature derived from the minimum values of a [[hash function]].\n\nThe \'\'\'Jaccard distance\'\'\', which measures \'\'dis\'\'similarity between sample sets, is complementary to the Jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting the Jaccard coefficient from 1, or, equivalently, by dividing the difference of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two sets by the size of the union:\n\n:<math> d_J(A,B) = 1 - J(A,B) = { { |A \\cup B| - |A \\cap B| } \\over |A \\cup B| }.</math>\n\nAn alternate interpretation of the Jaccard distance is as the ratio of the size of the [[symmetric difference]] <math>A \\triangle B = (A \\cup B) - (A \\cap B)</math> to the union. \n\nThis distance is a [[Distance function|metric]] on the collection of all finite sets.<ref name="lipkus">{{citation |last=Lipkus |first=Alan H\n|title=A proof of the triangle inequality for the Tanimoto distance\n|journal=J Math Chem |volume=26 |number=1-3 |year=1999 |pages=263\xe2\x80\x93265 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last1=Levandowsky |first1=Michael |last2=Winter |first2=David |title=Distance between sets|journal=Nature |volume=234 |number=5 |year=1971 |pages=34\xe2\x80\x9335 |doi=10.1038/234034a0}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a version of the Jaccard distance for [[measure (mathematics)|measures]], including [[probability measure]]s. If <math>\\mu</math> is a measure on a [[measurable space]] <math>X</math>, then we define the Jaccard coefficient by <math>J_\\mu(A,B) = {{\\mu(A \\cap B)} \\over {\\mu(A \\cup B)}}</math>, and the Jaccard distance by <math>d_\\mu(A,B) = 1 - J_\\mu(A,B) = {{\\mu(A \\triangle B)} \\over {\\mu(A \\cup B)}}</math>. Care must be taken if <math>\\mu(A \\cup B) = 0</math> or <math>\\infty</math>, since these formulas are not well defined in that case.\n\n== Similarity of asymmetric binary attributes ==\nGiven two objects, \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\', each with \'\'n\'\' [[binary numeral system|binary]] attributes, the Jaccard coefficient is a useful measure of the overlap that \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' share with their attributes.  Each attribute of \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' can either be 0 or 1.  The total number of each combination of attributes for both \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' are specified as follows:\n:<math>M_{11}</math> represents the total number of attributes where \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' both have a value of 1.\n:<math>M_{01}</math> represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of \'\'A\'\' is 0 and the attribute of \'\'B\'\' is 1.\n:<math>M_{10}</math> represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of \'\'A\'\' is 1 and the attribute of \'\'B\'\' is 0.\n:<math>M_{00}</math> represents the total number of attributes where \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' both have a value of 0.\nEach attribute must fall into one of these four categories, meaning that\n:<math>M_{11} + M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{00} = n.</math>\n\nThe Jaccard similarity coefficient, \'\'J\'\', is given as\n:<math>J = {M_{11} \\over M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11}}.</math>\n\nThe Jaccard distance, \'\'d\'\'<sub>\'\'J\'\'</sub>, is given as\n:<math>d_J = {M_{01} + M_{10} \\over M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11}}.</math>\n\n== Generalized Jaccard similarity and distance ==\n\nIf <math>\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)</math> and <math>\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)</math> are two vectors with all real <math>x_i, y_i \\geq 0</math>, then their Jaccard similarity coefficient is defined as\n:<math>J(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{\\sum_i \\min(x_i, y_i)}{\\sum_i \\max(x_i, y_i)},</math>\nand Jaccard distance\n:<math>d_J(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = 1 - J(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}).</math>\n\nWith even more generality, if <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> are two non-negative measurable functions on a measurable space <math>X</math> with measure <math>\\mu</math>, then we can define\n:<math>J(f, g) = \\frac{\\int\\min(f, g) d\\mu}{\\int \\max(f, g)  d\\mu},</math>\nwhere <math>\\max</math> and <math>\\min</math> are pointwise operators. Then Jaccard distance is\n:<math>d_J(f, g) = 1 - J(f, g).</math>\n\nThen, for example, for two measurable sets <math>A, B \\subseteq X</math>, we have <math>J_\\mu(A,B) = J(\\chi_A, \\chi_B),</math> where <math>\\chi_A</math> and <math>\\chi_B</math> are the characteristic functions of the corresponding set.\n\n== Tanimoto similarity and distance ==\n\n<!-- [[Tanimoto score]] redirects here, please change that redirect if you change this section title -->\n\nVarious forms of functions described as  Tanimoto similarity  and Tanimoto distance occur  in the literature and on the Internet.

It seems that this is  the most authoritative  source for the meaning of the terms "Tanimoto similarity" and "Tanimoto Distance". The similarity ratio is equivalent to Jaccard similarity, but the distance function is \'\'not\'\' the same as Jaccard distance.\n\n=== Tanimoto\'s definitions of similarity and distance ===\n\nIn that paper, a "similarity ratio" is  given over [[Bit array|bitmaps]], where each bit of a fixed-size array represents the presence or absence of a characteristic in the plant being modelled. The definition of the ratio is the number of common bits, divided by the number of bits set (i.e. nonzero) in either sample.\n\nPresented in mathematical terms, if samples \'\'X\'\' and \'\'Y\'\' are bitmaps, <math>X_i</math> is the \'\'i\'\'th bit of \'\'X\'\', and <math> \\land , \\lor </math> are [[bitwise operation|bitwise]] \'\'[[logical conjunction|and]]\'\', \'\'[[logical disjunction|or]]\'\' operators respectively, then the similarity ratio <math>T_s</math> is\n\n: <math> T_s(X,Y) =  \\frac{\\sum_i ( X_i \\land Y_i)}{\\sum_i ( X_i \\lor Y_i)}</math>\n\nIf each sample is modelled instead as a set of attributes, this value is  equal to the Jaccard coefficient of the two sets. Jaccard is not cited in the paper, and it seems likely that the authors were not aware of it.\n\nTanimoto goes on to define a "distance coefficient" based on this ratio, defined for bitmaps with non-zero similarity:\n\n: <math>T_d(X,Y) = -\\log_2 ( T_s(X,Y) ) </math>\n\nThis coefficient is, deliberately, not a distance metric. It is chosen to allow the possibility of two specimens, which are quite different from each other, to both be similar to a third. It is  easy to construct an example which disproves the property of [[Triangle inequality#Metric space|triangle inequality]].\n\n=== Other definitions of Tanimoto distance ===\n\nTanimoto distance is often referred to, erroneously, as a synonym for Jaccard distance <math> 1 - T_s</math>. This function is a proper distance metric. "Tanimoto Distance" is often stated as being a proper distance metric, probably because of its confusion with Jaccard distance.\n\nIf Jaccard or Tanimoto similarity is expressed over a bit vector, then it can be written as\n\n: <math>\nf(A,B) =\\frac{ A \\cdot B}{\\vert A\\vert^2 +\\vert B\\vert^2 -  A \\cdot B }\n</math>\n\nwhere the same calculation is expressed in terms of vector scalar product and magnitude. This representation relies on the fact that, for a bit vector (where the value of each dimension is either 0 or 1) then <math>A \\cdot B = \\sum_i A_iB_i = \\sum_i ( A_i \\land B_i)</math> and <math>{\\vert A\\vert}^2 = \\sum_i A_i^2 = \\sum_i A_i </math>.\n\nThis is a potentially confusing representation, because the function as expressed over vectors is more general, unless its domain is explicitly restricted. Properties of <math> T_s </math> do not necessarily extend to <math>f</math>. In particular, the difference function <math>1 - f</math> does not preserve [[triangle inequality]], and is not therefore a proper distance metric, whereas <math>1 - T_s </math> is.\n\nThere is a real danger that the combination of "Tanimoto Distance" being defined using this formula, along with the statement "Tanimoto Distance is a proper distance metric" will lead to the false conclusion that the function <math>1 - f</math> is in fact a distance metric over vectors or multisets in general, whereas its use in similarity search or clustering algorithms may fail to produce correct results.\n\nLipkus<ref name="lipkus" /> uses a definition of Tanimoto similarity which is equivalent to <math>f</math>, and refers to Tanimoto distance as the function <math> 1 - f</math>. It is however made clear within the paper that the context is restricted by the use of a (positive) weighting vector <math>W</math> such that, for any vector \'\'A\'\' being considered, <math> A_i \\in \\{0,W_i\\} </math>. Under these circumstances, the  function  is a proper distance metric, and so a set of vectors governed by such a weighting vector forms a metric space under this function.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S\xc3\xb8rensen similarity index]]\n* [[simple matching coefficient]]\n* [[Mountford\'s index of similarity]]\n* [[Most frequent k characters]]\n* [[Hamming distance]]\n* [[Dice\'s coefficient]], which is equivalent: <math>J=D/(2-D)</math> and <math>D=2J/(1+J)</math>\n* [[Tversky index]]\n* [[Correlation]]\n* [[Mutual information]], a normalized [[Mutual information#Metric|metricated]] variant of which is an entropic Jaccard distance.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2011}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|first1=Pang-Ning|last1=Tan|first2=Michael|last2=Steinbach|first3=Vipin|last3=Kumar|title=Introduction to Data Mining|year=2005|isbn=0-321-32136-7}}.\n*{{citation|first=Paul|last=Jaccard|authorlink=Paul Jaccard|year=1901|title=\xc3\x89tude comparative de la distribution florale dans une portion des Alpes et des Jura|journal=Bulletin de la Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 Vaudoise des Sciences Naturelles|volume=37|pages=547\xe2\x80\x93579}}.\n*{{citation|first=Paul|last=Jaccard|authorlink=Paul Jaccard|year=1912|title=The distribution of the flora in the alpine zone|journal=New Phytologist|volume=11|pages=37\xe2\x80\x9350|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1912.tb05611.x}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/dmslides/chap2_data.pdf Introduction to Data Mining lecture notes from Tan, Steinbach, Kumar]\n* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/ SimMetrics a sourceforge implementation of Jaccard index and many other similarity metrics]\n* [http://www.idea-miner.de/cgi-bin/INT_Tools/ver_vergleich_0_1/cmp_menu2.cgi Web based tool for comparing texts using Jaccard coefficient]\n* [http://www.gettingcirrius.com/2011/01/calculating-similarity-part-2-jaccard.html Tutorial on how to calculate different similarities]\n* Open Source [https://github.com/rockymadden/stringmetric/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/com/rockymadden/stringmetric/similarity/JaccardMetric.scala Jaccard] [[Scala programming language|Scala]] implementation as part of the larger [http://rockymadden.com/stringmetric/ stringmetric project]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaccard Index}}\n[[Category:Index numbers]]\n[[Category:Measure theory]]\n[[Category:Clustering criteria]]\n[[Category:String similarity measures]]'

S'{{No footnotes|date=July 2010}}\nIn [[computer science]], the \'\'\'string-to-string correction problem\'\'\' refers to the minimum number of edit operations necessary to change one [[String (computer science)|string]] into another. A single edit operation may be changing a single [[Character (computing)|symbol]] of the string into another, deleting, or inserting a symbol. The length of the edit sequence provides a measure of the [[Hamming distance|distance]] between the two strings.\n\nSeveral [[algorithm]]s exist to provide an efficient way to determine string distance and specify the minimum number of transformation operations required. Such algorithms are particularly useful for [[Delta encoding|delta]] creation operations where something is stored as a set of differences relative to a base version. This allows several versions of a single object to be stored much more efficiently than storing them separately. This holds true even for single versions of several objects if they do not differ greatly, or anything in between. \nNotably, such difference algorithms are used in [[molecular biology]] to provide some measure of kinship between different kinds of organisms based on the similarities of their [[macromolecule]]s (such as [[protein]]s or [[DNA]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Delta encoding]]\n* [[Levenshtein distance]]\n* [[Edit distance]]\n\n== References ==\n<div class="references-small">\n*{{cite journal |first=Robert A. |last=Wagner |first2=Michael J. |last2=Fischer |author2-link=Michael J.

This model assumes that this probability of relevance depends on the query and document representations. Furthermore, it assumes that there is a portion of all documents that is preferred by the user as the answer set for query ''q''. Such an ideal answer set is called ''R'' and should maximize the overall probability of relevance to that user. The prediction is that documents in this set ''R'' are relevant to the query, while documents not present in the set are non-relevant.\n\n<math>sim(d_{j},q) = \\frac{P(R|\\vec{d}_j)}{P(\\bar{R}|\\vec{d}_j)}</math>\n\n==Related models==\nThere are some limitations to this framework that need to be addressed by further development:\n* There is no accurate estimate for the first run probabilities\n* Index terms are not weighted\n* Terms are assumed mutually independent\n\nTo address these and other concerns there are some developed models from the probabilistic relevance framework. The [[Binary Independence Model]] for one, as it is from the same author.

Adding transpositions adds significant complexity. The difference between the two algorithms consists in that the \'\'optimal string alignment algorithm\'\' computes the number of edit operations needed to make the strings equal under the condition that \'\'\'no substring is edited more than once\'\'\', whereas the second one presents no such restriction.\n\nTake for example the edit distance between \'\'\'CA\'\'\' and \'\'\'ABC\'\'\'. The Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance LD(\'\'\'CA\'\'\',\'\'\'ABC\'\'\') = 2 because \'\'\'CA\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'AC\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'ABC\'\'\', but the optimal string alignment distance OSA(\'\'\'CA\'\'\',\'\'\'ABC\'\'\') = 3 because if the operation \'\'\'CA\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'AC\'\'\' is used, it is not possible to use \'\'\'AC\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'ABC\'\'\' because that would require the substring to be edited more than once, which is not allowed in OSA, and therefore the shortest sequence of operations is \'\'\'CA\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'A\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'AB\'\'\' \xe2\x86\x92 \'\'\'ABC\'\'\'. Note that for the optimal string alignment distance, the [[triangle inequality]] does not hold: OSA(\'\'\'CA\'\'\',\'\'\'AC\'\'\') + OSA(\'\'\'AC\'\'\',\'\'\'ABC\'\'\') < OSA(\'\'\'CA\'\'\',\'\'\'ABC\'\'\'), and so it is not a true metric.\n \n===Optimal string alignment distance===\nFirstly, let us consider a direct extension of the formula used to calculate [[Levenshtein distance]].  Below is [[pseudocode]] for a function \'\'OptimalStringAlignmentDistance\'\' that takes two strings, \'\'str1\'\' of length \'\'lenStr1\'\', and \'\'str2\'\' of length \'\'lenStr2\'\', and computes the optimal string alignment distance between them:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang="pascal">\n int OptimalStringAlignmentDistance(char str1[1..lenStr1], char str2[1..lenStr2])\n    // d is a table with lenStr1+1 rows and lenStr2+1 columns\n    declare int d[0..lenStr1, 0..lenStr2]\n\n    // i and j are used to iterate over str1 and str2\n    declare int i, j, cost\n\n    // for loop is inclusive, need table 1 row/column larger than string length\n    for i from 0 to lenStr1\n        d[i, 0] := i\n    for j from 1 to lenStr2\n        d[0, j] := j\n\n    // pseudo-code assumes string indices start at 1, not 0\n    // if implemented, make sure to start comparing at 1st letter of strings\n    for i from 1 to lenStr1\n        for j from 1 to lenStr2\n            if str1[i] = str2[j] then cost := 0\n                                 else cost := 1\n            d[i, j] := minimum(\n                                 d[i-1, j  ] + 1,     // deletion\n                                 d[i  , j-1] + 1,     // insertion\n                                 d[i-1, j-1] + cost   // substitution\n                             )\n            if(i > 1 and j > 1 and str1[i] = str2[j-1] and str1[i-1] = str2[j]) then\n                d[i, j] := minimum(\n                                 d[i, j],\n                                 d[i-2, j-2] + cost   // transposition\n                              )                        \n  \n    return d[lenStr1, lenStr2]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBasically this is the algorithm to compute [[Levenshtein distance]] with one additional recurrence:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang="pascal">\n            if(i > 1 and j > 1 and str1[i] = str2[j-1] and str1[i-1] = str2[j]) then\n                d[i, j] := minimum(\n                                 d[i, j],\n                                 d[i-2, j-2] + cost   // transposition\n                              )\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Distance with adjacent transpositions===\nHere is the second algorithm that computes the true Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance with adjacent transpositions (ActionScript 3.0); this function requires as an additional parameter the size of the alphabet (\'\'C\'\'), so that all entries of the arrays are in 0..(\'\'C\'\'&minus;1):\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\'actionscript3\'>static public function damerauLevenshteinDistance(a:Array, b:Array, C:uint):uint\n{\n    // "infinite" distance is just the max possible distance\n    var INF:uint = a.length + b.length;\n\n    // make and initialize the character array indices            \n    var DA:Array = new Array(C);\n    for (var k:uint = 0; k < C; ++k) DA[k]=0;\n\n    // make the distance matrix H[-1..a.length][-1..b.length]\n    var H:matrix = new matrix(a.length+2,b.length+2);\n    \n    // initialize the left and top edges of H\n    H[-1][-1] = INF;\n    for (var i:uint = 0; i <= a.length; ++i)\n    {\n        H[i][-1] = INF;\n        H[i][ 0] = i;\n    }\n    for (var j:uint = 0; j <= b.length; ++j)\n    {\n        H[-1][j] = INF;\n        H[ 0][j] = j;\n    }\n\n    // fill in the distance matrix H\n    // look at each character in a\n    for (var i:uint = 1; i <= a.length; ++i)\n    {\n        var DB:uint = 0;\n        // look at each character in b\n        for (var j:uint = 1; j <= b.length; ++j)\n        {\n            var i1:uint = DA[b[j-1]];\n            var j1:uint = DB;\n            var cost:uint;\n            if (a[i-1] == b[j-1])\n               {\n                 cost = 0;\n                 DB   = j;\n               }\n            else\n               cost = 1;\n            H[i][j] = Math.min(    H[i-1 ][j-1 ] + cost,  // substitution\n                                   H[i   ][j-1 ] + 1,     // insertion\n                                   H[i-1 ][j   ] + 1,     // deletion\n                                   H[i1-1][j1-1] + (i-i1-1) + 1 + (j-j1-1));\n        }\n        DA[a[i-1]] = i;\n    }\n    return H[a.length][b.length];\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n:<small>\'\'\'Note\'\'\': the algorithm given in the paper uses alphabet 1..C rather than the 0..\'\'C\'\'&minus;1 used here; the paper indexes arrays: H[&minus;1..|A|,&minus;1..|B|] and DA[1..C]; here DA[0..C&minus;1] is used; the paper seems to be missing the necessary line H[&minus;1,&minus;1]&nbsp;=&nbsp;INF</small>\n\nTo devise a proper algorithm to calculate unrestricted Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance note that there always exists an optimal sequence of edit operations, where once-transposed letters are never modified afterwards. (This holds as long as the cost of a transposition, <math>W_T</math>, is at least the average of the cost of an insertion and deletion, i.e., <math>2W_T \\ge W_I+W_D</math>.<ref name="LW75"/>) Thus, we need to consider only two symmetric ways of modifying a substring more than once: (1) transpose letters and insert an arbitrary number of characters between them, or (2) delete a sequence of characters and transpose letters that become adjacent after deletion. The straightforward implementation of this idea gives an algorithm of cubic complexity: <math>O\\left (M \\cdot N \\cdot \\max(M, N) \\right )</math>, where \'\'M\'\' and \'\'N\'\' are string lengths. Using the ideas of Lowrance and Wagner,<ref name="LW75"/> this naive algorithm can be improved to be <math>O\\left (M \\cdot N \\right)</math> in the worst case.\n\nIt is interesting that the [[bitap algorithm]] can be modified to process transposition. See the information retrieval section of{{ref|itman}} for an example of such an adaptation.\n\n== Applications ==\nDamerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance plays an important role in [[natural language processing]]. In natural languages, strings are short and the number of errors (misspellings) rarely exceeds 2. In such circumstances, restricted and real edit distance differ very rarely. Oommen and Loke{{ref|OO}} even mitigated the limitation of the restricted edit distance by introducing \'\'generalized transpositions\'\'. Nevertheless, one must remember that the restricted edit distance usually does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] and, thus, cannot be used with [[metric tree]]s.\n\n=== DNA ===\nSince [[DNA]] frequently undergoes insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions, and each of these operations occurs on approximately the same timescale, the Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein distance is an appropriate metric of the variation between two strands of DNA. More common in DNA, protein, and other bioinformatics related alignment tasks is the use of closely related algorithms such as [[Needleman\xe2\x80\x93Wunsch algorithm]] or [[Smith\xe2\x80\x93Waterman algorithm]].\n\n=== Fraud detection ===\nThe algorithm can be used with any set of words, like vendor names. Since entry is manual by nature there is a risk of entering a false vendor. A fraudster employee may enter one real vendor such as "Rich Heir Estate Services" versus a false vendor "Rich Hier State Services". The fraudster would then create a false bank account and have the company route checks to the real vendor and false vendor. The Damerau\xe2\x80\x93Levenshtein algorithm will detect the transposed and dropped letter and bring attention of the items to a fraud examiner.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Approximate string matching]]\n* [[Levenshtein automata]]\n* [[Typosquatting]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Citation |first=Gonzalo |last=Navarro |title=A guided tour to approximate string matching |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=31\xe2\x80\x9388 |date=March 2001 |doi=10.1145/375360.375365 }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Damerau-Levenshtein Distance}}\n[[Category:String similarity measures]]\n[[Category:Information theory]]\n[[Category:Dynamic programming]]'

S"In [[probability theory|probability]] and [[mathematical statistics|statistics]], the '''Hellinger distance''' (also called [[Bhattacharyya distance]] as this was originally introduced by [[Anil Kumar Bhattacharya]]) is used to quantify the similarity between two [[probability distributions]]. It is a type of [[f-divergence|''f''-divergence]].  The Hellinger distance is defined in terms of the [[Hellinger integral]], which was introduced by [[Ernst Hellinger]] in 1909.<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Hellinger distance|id=h/h046890|first=M.S. |last=Nikulin}}</ref><ref>{{Citation \n| last = Hellinger \n| first = Ernst\n| author-link = Ernst Hellinger\n| title = Neue Begr\xc3\xbcndung der Theorie quadratischer Formen von unendlichvielen Ver\xc3\xa4nderlichen \n| url = http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN002166941 \n| year = 1909 \n| journal = [[Journal f\xc3\xbcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]\n| language = German\n| volume = 136 \n| pages = 210\xe2\x80\x93271\n| jfm = 40.0393.01\n| doi=10.1515/crll.1909.136.210\n}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Measure theory===\nTo define the Hellinger distance in terms of [[measure theory]], let ''P'' and ''Q'' denote two [[probability measure]]s that are [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to a third probability measure &lambda;.  The square of the Hellinger distance between ''P'' and ''Q'' is defined as the quantity\n\n:<math>H^2(P,Q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle \\int \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{dP}{d\\lambda}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{dQ}{d\\lambda}}\\right)^2 d\\lambda. </math>\n\nHere, ''dP''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''d&lambda;'' and ''dQ''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''d''&lambda; are the [[Radon\xe2\x80\x93Nikodym derivative]]s of ''P'' and ''Q'' respectively.  This definition does not depend on &lambda;, so the Hellinger distance between ''P'' and ''Q'' does not change if &lambda; is replaced with a different probability measure with respect to which both  ''P'' and ''Q'' are absolutely continuous.  For compactness, the above formula is often written as\n\n:<math>H^2(P,Q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int \\left(\\sqrt{dP} - \\sqrt{dQ}\\right)^2. </math>\n\n===Probability theory using Lebesgue measure===\nTo define the Hellinger distance in terms of elementary probability theory, we take &lambda; to be [[Lebesgue measure]], so that ''dP''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''d&lambda;'' and ''dQ''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''d''&lambda; are simply [[probability density function]]s.  If we denote the densities as ''f'' and ''g'', respectively, the squared Hellinger distance can be expressed as a standard calculus integral\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\left(\\sqrt{f(x)} - \\sqrt{g(x)}\\right)^2 dx = 1 - \\int \\sqrt{f(x) g(x)} \\, dx,</math>\n\nwhere the second form can be obtained by expanding the square and using the fact that the integral of a probability density over its domain must be one.\n\nThe Hellinger distance ''H''(''P'',&nbsp;''Q'') satisfies the property (derivable from the [[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality#L2|Cauchy-Schwarz inequality]])\n\n: <math>0\\le H(P,Q) \\le 1.</math>\n\n===Discrete distributions===\nFor two discrete probability distributions <math>P=(p_1 \\ldots p_k)</math> and <math>Q=(q_1 \\ldots q_k)</math>,\ntheir Hellinger distance is defined as\n\n: <math>\n  H(P, Q) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\; \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} (\\sqrt{p_i} - \\sqrt{q_i})^2},\n</math>\n\nwhich is directly related to the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean norm]] of the difference of the square root vectors, i.e.\n: <math>\nH(P, Q) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\; \\bigl\\|\\sqrt{P} - \\sqrt{Q} \\bigr\\|_2 .\n</math>\n\n== Connection with the statistical distance ==\n\nThe Hellinger distance <math>H(P,Q)</math> and the [[total variation distance]] (or statistical distance) <math>\\delta(P,Q)</math> are related as follows:<ref>[http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/teaching/2011-12/comm/lectures/l12.pdf Harsha's lecture notes on communication complexity]</ref>\n\n: <math>\nH^2(P,Q) \\leq \\delta(P,Q) \\leq \\sqrt 2 H(P,Q)\\,.\n</math>\n\nThese inequalities follow immediately from the inequalities between the [[Lp space#The p-norm in finite dimensions|1-norm]] and the [[Lp space#The p-norm in finite dimensions|2-norm]].\n\n==Properties==\nThe maximum distance 1 is achieved when ''P'' assigns probability zero to every set to which ''Q'' assigns a positive probability, and vice versa.\n\nSometimes the factor 1/2 in front of the integral is omitted, in which case the Hellinger distance ranges from zero to the square root of two.\n\nThe Hellinger distance is related to the [[Bhattacharyya distance|Bhattacharyya coefficient]] <math>BC(P,Q)</math> as it can be defined as\n\n: <math>H(P,Q) = \\sqrt{1 - BC(P,Q)}.</math>\n\nHellinger distances are used in the theory of [[sequential analysis|sequential]] and [[asymptotic statistics]].<ref>Erik Torgerson (1991) ''Comparison of Statistical Experiments'', volume 36 of Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

S'{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\nThe \'\'\'anchor text\'\'\', \'\'\'link label\'\'\', \'\'\'link text\'\'\', or \'\'\'link title\'\'\' is the visible, clickable text in a [[hyperlink]]. The words contained in the anchor text can determine the ranking that the page will receive by search engines. Since 1998, some [[web browser]]s have added the ability to show a [[tooltip]] for a hyperlink before it is selected. Not all links have anchor texts because it may be obvious where the link will lead due to the context in which it is used. Anchor texts normally remain below 60 [[Character (computing)|characters]]. Different browsers will display anchor texts differently. Usually, Web Search Engines analyze anchor text from hyperlinks on web pages. Other services apply the basic principles of anchor text analysis as well. For instance, [[List of academic databases and search engines|academic search engines]] may use [[citation]] context to classify [[Academic publishing|academic articles]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Bader Aljaber, Nicola Stokes, James Bailey and Jian Pei|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p278617582u5x3x1/|title=Document clustering of scientific texts using citation contexts |date=1 April 2010|publisher=Springer}}</ref> and anchor text from documents linked in [[mind maps]] may be used too.<ref>Needs new reference link</ref> [[File:Anchor text.png|thumb|Visual implementation of anchor text]]\n\n==Overview==\nAnchor text usually gives the user relevant descriptive or contextual information about the content of the link\'s destination. The anchor text may or may not be related to the actual text of the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the link. For example, a hyperlink to the [[English Wikipedia|English-language Wikipedia]]\'s [[homepage]] might take this form:\n\n:<code><nowiki><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a></nowiki></code>\n\nThe anchor text in this example is "Wikipedia"; the longer, but vital, URL <code><nowiki>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</nowiki></code> needed to locate the target page, displays on the web page as {{srlink|Main Page|Wikipedia}}, contributing to clean, easy-to-read text.\n\n==Common misunderstanding of the concept==\n\nThis proper method of linking is beneficial to users and [[webmaster]]s as anchor text holds [[significant]] [[weight]] in [[search engine]] rankings. The limit of the [[concept]] is building [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s only composed with linked [[word]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Search engine algorithms==\nAnchor text is weighted (ranked) highly in [[search engine]] [[algorithm]]s, because the linked text is usually relevant to the [[landing page]]. The objective of search engines is to provide highly relevant search results; this is where anchor text helps, as the tendency was, more often than not, to hyperlink words relevant to the landing page.

S"The '''Social Sciences Citation Index''' ('''SSCI''') is an interdisciplinary  [[citation index]] product of  [[Thomson Reuters]]' Healthcare & Science division. It was developed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] (ISI) from the [[Science Citation Index]].\n\nThis citation database covers some 2,474 of the world's leading [[academic journal|journals]] of [[social sciences]] across more than 50 [[academic discipline|disciplines]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Social Sciences Citation Index \n  | url = http://scientific.thomson.com/products/ssci/\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-11 }}</ref> It is made available online through the [[Web of Science]] service for a fee.  This database product provides information to identify the articles  cited most frequently and by what publisher and author.\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn 2004 economists [[Daniel B. Klein]] and Eric Chiang conducted a survey of the Social Sciences Citation Index and identified a bias against free market oriented research. In addition to an ideological bias, Klein and Chiang also identified several methodological deficiencies that encouraged the over-counting of citations, and they argue that the Social Sciences Citation Index does a poor job reflecting the relevance and accuracy of articles.<ref>Daniel Klein and Eric Chiang.

S'{{Citations missing|date=June 2008}}\n\n\'\'\'Federated search\'\'\' is an [[information retrieval]] technology that allows the simultaneous search of multiple searchable resources.  A user makes a single query request which is distributed to the [[search engine]]s participating in the federation.  The federated search then aggregates the results that are received from the [[search engine]]s for presentation to the user.\n\n==Purpose==\nFederated search came about to meet the need of searching multiple  disparate content sources with one query.  This allows a user to search multiple databases at once in real time, arrange the results from the various databases into a useful form and then present the results to the user.\n\n==Process==\nAs described by Peter Jacso (2004<ref>Thoughts About Federated Searching.  Jacs\xc3\xb3, P\xc3\xa9ter, Information Today,  Oct 2004, Vol. 21, Issue 9</ref>), federated searching consists of (1) transforming a [[Web search query|query]] and broadcasting it to a group of disparate databases or other web resources, with the appropriate syntax, (2) merging the results collected from the databases, (3) presenting them in a succinct and unified format with minimal duplication, and (4) providing a means, performed either automatically or by the portal user, to sort the merged result set.\n\nFederated search portals, either commercial or open access, generally search public access [[bibliographic databases]], public access Web-based library catalogues ([[OPAC]]s), Web-based search engines like [[Google]] and/or open-access, government-operated or corporate data collections. These individual information sources send back to the portal\'s interface a list of results from the search query. The user can review this hit list.  Some portals will merely [[screen scrape]] the actual database results and not directly allow a user to enter the information source\'s application. More sophisticated ones will de-dupe the results list by merging and removing duplicates. There are additional features available in many portals, but the basic idea is the same: to improve the accuracy and relevance of individual searches as well as reduce the amount of time required to search for resources.\n\nThis process allows federated search some key advantages when compared with existing crawler-based search engines.  Federated search need not place any requirements or burdens on owners of the individual information sources, other than handling increased traffic.  Federated searches are inherently as current as the individual information sources, as they are searched in real time.\n\n==Implementation==\n[[File:Fed_search.png|thumb|alt=federated search engine|Federating across three search engines]]\n\nOne application of federated searching is the [[metasearch engine]]; however, this is not a complete solution as many documents are not currently indexed. These documents are on what is known as the [[deep Web]], or invisible Web. Many more information sources are not yet stored in electronic form. [[Google Scholar]] is one example of many projects trying to address this.\n\nWhen the search vocabulary or [[data model]] of the search system is different from the data model of one or more of the foreign target systems the query must be translated into each of the foreign target systems.  This can be done using simple data-element translation or may require [[semantic translation]].\n\nA challenge faced in the implementation of federated search engines is scalability, in other words, the performance of the site as the number of information sources comprising the federated search engine increase. One federated search engine that has begun to address this issue is [[WorldWideScience]], hosted by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]\'s [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]].  WorldWideScience <ref>[http://www.worldwidescience.org WorldWideScience]</ref> is composed of more than 40 information sources, several of which are federated search portals themselves.  One such portal is Science.gov <ref name="Science.gov">[http://www.science.gov Science.gov]</ref> which itself federates more than 30 information sources representing most of the R&D output of the U.S. Federal government.  Science.gov returns its highest ranked results to WorldWideScience, which then merges and ranks these results with the search returned by the other information sources that comprise WorldWideScience.<ref name="Science.gov"/> This approach of cascaded federated search enables large number of information sources to be searched via a single query.\n\nAnother application [[Sesam]] running in both Norway and Sweden has been built on top of an open sourced platform specialised for federated search solutions. Sesat,<ref>[http://sesat.no Sesat]</ref> an acronym for [[Sesam Search Application Toolkit]], is a platform that provides much of the framework and functionality required for handling parallel and pipelined searches and displaying them elegantly in a user interface, allowing engineers to focus on the index/database configuration tuning.\n\n==Challenges==\n\nWhen federated search is performed against secure data sources, the users\' credentials must be passed on\nto each underlying search engine, so that appropriate security is maintained.  If the user has different\nlogin credentials for different systems, there must be a means to map their login ID to each search\nengine\'s security domain.<ref>[http://www.ideaeng.com/tabId/98/itemId/124/Mapping-Security-Requirements-to-Enterprise-Search.aspx Mapping Security Requirements to Enterprise Search]</ref>\n\nAnother challenge is mapping results list navigators into a common form.  Suppose 3 real-estate sites are searched, each provides a list of hyperlinked city names to click on, to see matches only in each city.  Ideally these facets would be combined into one set, but that presents additional technical challenges.<ref>[http://www.ideaeng.com/tabId/98/itemId/154/20-Differences-Between-Internet-vs-Enterprise-Se.aspx#fed_facets 20+ Differences Between Internet vs. Enterprise Search - part 1]</ref>  The system also needs to understand "next page" links if it\'s going to allow the user to page through the combined results.\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6571320.html Federated Search 101.

S'{{Third-party|date=February 2013}}\n\'\'\'The Materials Science Citation Index\'\'\' is a [[citation index]], established in 1992, by [[Thomson ISI]] ([[Thomson Reuters]]). Its overall focus is [[citation|cited reference]] searching of the notable and significant [[science journal|journal literature]] in [[materials science]]. The database makes accessible the various [[physical properties|properties]], behaviors, and materials in the materials science discipline. This then encompasses [[applied physics]], [[ceramic engineering|ceramics]], [[Advanced composite materials (science & engineering)|composite materials]], [[metals]] and [[metallurgy]], [[polymer engineering]], [[semiconductors]], [[thin films]], [[biomaterial]]s, [[Dentistry|dental technology]], as well as [[optics]]. The [[database]] indexes relevant materials science information from over 6,000 [[scientific journal]]s that are part of the ISI database which is [[multidisciplinary]]. Author abstracts are searchable, which links articles sharing one or more [[bibliographic]] references.

S'\'\'\'Multi-document summarization\'\'\' is an automatic procedure aimed at [[information extraction|extraction of information]] from multiple texts written about the same topic. Resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the [[news aggregators]] performing the next step down the road of coping with [[information overload]].\n\n==Key benefits==\nMulti-[[document summarization]] creates information reports that are both concise and comprehensive.\nWith different opinions being put together & outlined, every topic is described from multiple perspectives within a single document.\nWhile the goal of a brief summary is to simplify information search and cut the time by pointing to the most relevant source documents, comprehensive multi-document summary should itself contain the required information, hence limiting the need for accessing original files to cases when refinement is required.\nAutomatic summaries present information extracted from multiple sources algorithmically, without any editorial touch or subjective human intervention, thus making it completely unbiased.\n\n==Technological challenges==\nThe multi-document summarization task has turned out to be much more complex than [[automatic summarization|summarizing a single document]], even a very large one. This difficulty arises from inevitable thematic diversity within a large set of documents. A good summarization technology aims to combine the main themes with completeness, readability, and conciseness. Document Understanding Conferences,<ref>http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/index.html</ref> conducted annually by [[NIST]], have developed sophisticated evaluation criteria for techniques accepting the multi-document summarization challenge.\n\nAn ideal multi-document summarization system does not simply shorten the source texts but presents information organized around the key aspects to represent a wider diversity of views on the topic. When such quality is achieved, an automatic multi-document summary is perceived more like an overview of a given topic. The latter implies that such text compilations should also meet other basic requirements for an overview text compiled by a human. The multi-document summary quality criteria are as follows:\n*clear structure, including an outline of the main content, from which it is easy to navigate to the full text sections\n*text within sections is divided into meaningful paragraphs\n*gradual transition from more general to more specific thematic aspects\n*good [[readability]]\n\nThe latter point deserves additional note - special care is taken in order to ensure that the automatic overview shows:\n*no paper-unrelated "[[communication noise|information noise]]" from the respective documents (e.g., web pages)\n*no dangling references to what is not mentioned or explained in the overview\n*no text breaks across a sentence\n*no semantic [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]].\n\n==Real-life systems==\nThe multi-document summarization technology is now coming of age - a view supported by a choice of advanced web-based systems that are currently available.\n* Ultimate Research Assistant<ref>http://ultimate-research-assistant.com/</ref> - performs text mining on Internet search results to help summarize and organize them and make it easier for the user to perform online research. Specific text mining techniques used by the tool include concept extraction, text summarization, hierarchical concept clustering (e.g., automated taxonomy generation), and various visualization techniques, including tag clouds and mind maps. \n* iResearch Reporter<ref>http://www.iresearch-reporter.com/</ref> - Commercial Text Extraction and Text Summarization system, free demo site accepts user-entered query, passes it on to Google search engine, retrieves multiple relevant documents, produces categorized, easily  readable natural language summary reports covering multiple documents in retrieved set, all extracts linked to original documents on the Web, post-processing, entity extraction, event and relationship extraction, text extraction, extract clustering, linguistic analysis, multi-document, full text, natural language processing, categorization rules, clustering, linguistic analysis, text summary construction tool set.\n* Newsblaster<ref>http://newsblaster.cs.columbia.edu</ref> is a system that helps users find news that is of the most interest to them. The system automatically collects, clusters, categorizes, and summarizes news from several sites on the web ([[CNN]], [[Reuters]], [[Fox News]], etc.) on a daily basis, and it provides users an interface to browse the results.\n* NewsInEssence<ref>http://www.newsinessence.com</ref> may be used to retrieve and summarize a cluster of articles from the web. It can start from a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] and retrieve documents that are similar, or it can retrieve documents that match a given set of keywords. NewsInEssence also downloads news articles daily and produces news clusters from them.\n* NewsFeed Researcher<ref>http://newsfeedresearcher.com</ref> is a news portal performing continuous [[automatic summarization]] of documents initially clustered by the [[news aggregators]] (e.g., [[Google News]]). NewsFeed Researcher is backed by a free online engine covering major events related to business, technology, U.S. and international news. This tool is also available in on-demand mode allowing a user to build a summaries on selected topics.\n* Scrape This<ref>http://www.scrapethis.com</ref> is like a search engine, but instead of providing links to the most relevant websites based on a query, it scrapes the pertinent information off of the relevant websites and provides the user with a consolidated multi-document summary, along with dictionary definitions, images, and videos.\n* JistWeb<ref>http://www.jastatechnologies.com/productList.html</ref> is a query specific multiple document summariser.\n\nAs auto-generated multi-document summaries increasingly resemble the overviews written by a human, their use of extracted text snippets may one day face [[copyright]] issues in relation to the [[fair use]] copyright concept.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* G\xc3\xbcnes Erkan and Dragomir R.

S'A \'\'\'citation index\'\'\' is a kind of [[bibliographic database]], an index of [[citation]]s between publications, allowing the user to easily establish which later documents cite which earlier documents. A form of citation index is first found in 12th-century Hebrew religious literature. Legal citation indexes are found in the 18th century and were made popular by [[citator]]s such as [[Shepard\'s Citations]] (1873). In 1960, [[Eugene Garfield]]\'s [[Institute for Scientific Information]] (ISI) introduced the first citation index for papers published in [[academic journal]]s, first the \'\'[[Science Citation Index]]\'\' (SCI), and later the \'\'[[Social Sciences Citation Index]]\'\' (SSCI) and the \'\'[[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]]\'\' (AHCI). The first automated citation indexing was done by [[CiteSeer]] in 1997. Other sources for such data include [[Google Scholar]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest known citation index is an index of biblical citations in [[rabbinic literature]], the \'\'Mafteah ha-Derashot\'\', attributed to [[Maimonides]] and probably dating to the 12th century. It is organized alphabetically by biblical phrase. Later biblical citation indexes are in the order of the canonical text. These citation indices were used both for general and for legal study.  The Talmudic citation index \'\'En Mishpat\'\' (1714) even included a symbol to indicate whether a Talmudic decision had been overridden, just as in the 19th-century \'\'Shepard\'s Citations\'\'.<ref>Bella Hass Weinberg, "The Earliest Hebrew Citation Indexes" in Trudi Bellardo Hahn, Michael Keeble Buckland, eds., \'\'Historical Studies in Information Science\'\', 1998,  p. 51\'\'ff\'\'</ref><ref>Bella Hass Weinberg, "Predecessors of Scientific Indexing Structures in the Domain of Religion" in W. Boyden Rayward, Mary Ellen Bowden, \'\'The History and Heritage of Scientific and Technological Information Systems\'\', Proceedings of the 2002 Conference, 2004, p. 126\'\'ff\'\'</ref> Unlike modern scholarly citation indexes, only references to one work, the Bible, were indexed.\n\nIn English legal literature, volumes of judicial reports included lists of cases cited in that volume starting with \'\'Raymond\'s Reports\'\' (1743) and followed by \'\'Douglas\'s Reports\'\' (1783). Simon Greenleaf (1821) published an alphabetical list of cases with notes on later decisions affecting the precedential authority of the original decision.<ref name=\'shapiro\'/>\n\nThe first true citation index dates to the 1860 publication of Labatt\'s \'\'Table of Cases...California...\'\', followed in 1872 by Wait\'s \'\'Table of Cases...New York...\'\'. But the most important and best-known citation index came with the 1873 publication of [[Shepard\'s Citations]].<ref name=\'shapiro\'>Fred R. Shapiro, "Origins of Bibliometrics, Citation Indexing, and Citation Analysis: The Neglected Legal Literature" \'\'Journal of the American Society of Information Science\'\' \'\'\'43\'\'\':5:337-339 (1992)</ref>\n\n==Major citation indexing services==\n{{main|Indexing and abstracting service}}\n{{main cat|Citation indices}}\n\nGeneral-purpose academic citation indexes include:\n\n*ISI (now part of [[Thomson Reuters]]) publishes the ISI citation indexes in print and [[compact disc]]. They are now generally accessed through the Web under the name \'\' [[Web of Science]]\'\', which is in turn part of the group of databases in the \'\'[[Web of Knowledge]].\'\'\n*[[Elsevier]] publishes [[Scopus]], available online only, which similarly combines subject searching with citation browsing and tracking in the sciences and [[social sciences]].\n*[[Indian Citation Index (ICI)|Indian Citation Index]] is an online citation data which covers [[peer review]]ed journals published from India. It covers major subject areas such as scientific, technical, medical, and [[social sciences]] and includes arts and humanities. The citation database is the first of its kind in India.\nEach of these offer an index of citations between publications and a mechanism to establish which documents cite which other documents. They differ widely in cost: the ISI databases and Scopus are available by subscription (generally to libraries).\n\nIn addition, [[CiteSeer]] and [[Google Scholar]] are freely available online.\n\n==Citation analysis==\n{{main|Citation analysis}}\n{{merge|section=yes|Citation analysis|date=December 2013}}\n{{duplication|dupe=Citation analysis|date=December 2013}}\n\nWhile citation indexes were originally designed for [[information retrieval]], they are increasingly used for [[bibliometrics]] and other studies involving research evaluation. Citation data is also the basis of the popular [[journal impact factor]].\n\nThere is a large body of literature on [[citation analysis]], sometimes called [[scientometrics]], a term invented by [[Vasily Nalimov]], or more specifically [[bibliometrics]]. The field blossomed with the advent of the [[Science Citation Index]], which now covers source literature from 1900 on. The leading journals of the field are \'\'[[Scientometrics]],\'\' \'\'Informetrics,\'\' and the \'\'[[Journal of the American Society of Information Science and Technology]]\'\'. [[American Society for Information Science and Technology|ASIST]] also hosts an [[electronic mailing list]] called SIGMETRICS at  ASIST.<ref>{{cite web | title=The American Society for Information Science & Technology | work=The Information Society for the Information Age | url=http://www.asis.org| accessdate=2006-05-21}}</ref> This method is undergoing a resurgence based on the wide dissemination of the Web of Science and Scopus subscription databases in many universities, and the universally available free citation tools such as  [[CiteBase]],  [[CiteSeerX]], [[Google Scholar]], and the former [[Windows Live Academic]] (now available with extra features as [[Microsoft Academic Search]]).\n\n[[Legal citation]] analysis is a citation analysis technique for analyzing [[legal documents]] to facilitate the understanding of the inter-related regulatory compliance documents by the exploration the citations that connect provisions to other provisions within the same document or between different documents. Legal citation analysis uses a [[citation graph]] extracted from a regulatory document, which could supplement [[E-discovery]] - a process that leverages on technological innovations in [[big data analytics]].<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/wrapper.jsp?arnumber=5070630&tag=1 ]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref><ref>Mohammad Hamdaqa and A.

The [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] became one of the first databases to be mounted on the [[Dialog]] system<ref>{{cite web | title=Dialog, A Thomson Business | work="Dialog invented online information services" | url=http://www.dialog.com| accessdate=2006-05-21}}</ref> in 1972. With the advent of the [[CD-ROM]] edition, linking became even easier and enabled the use of [[bibliographic coupling]] for finding related records. In 1973, Henry Small published his classic work on [[Co-Citation analysis]] which became a [[self-organizing]] classification system that led to [[document clustering]] experiments and eventually an "Atlas of Science" later called "Research Reviews".\n\nThe inherent topological and graphical nature of the worldwide citation network which is an inherent property of the [[scientific literature]] was described by [[Ralph Garner]] ([[Drexel University]]) in 1965.<ref>http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/rgarner.pdf</ref>\n\nThe use of citation counts to rank journals was a technique used in the early part of the nineteenth century but the systematic ongoing measurement of these counts for scientific journals was initiated by Eugene Garfield at the Institute for Scientific Information who also pioneered the use of these counts  to rank authors and [[academic paper|papers]].  In a landmark paper of 1965 he and [[Irving Sher]] showed the correlation between citation frequency and eminence in demonstrating that [[Nobel Prize]] winners published five times the average number of papers while their work was cited 30 to 50 times the average. In a long series of essays on the Nobel and other prizes Garfield reported this phenomenon.  The usual summary measure is known as [[impact factor]], the number of citations to a journal for the previous two years, divided by the number of articles published in those years. It is widely used, both for appropriate and inappropriate purposes\xe2\x80\x94in particular, the use of this measure alone for  ranking authors and papers is therefore [[Impact factor#|quite controversial.]]\n\nIn an early study in 1964 of the use of Citation Analysis in writing the history of [[DNA]], Garfield and Sher demonstrated the potential for generating [[historiograph]]s, [[topological map]]s of the most important steps in the history of scientific topics. This work was later automated by E. Garfield, [[A. I. Pudovkin]] of the [[Institute of Marine Biology]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[V. S. Istomin]] of [[Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology]], [[Washington State University]] and led to the creation of the [[Histcite|HistCite]] <ref>{{cite web | author=Eugene Garfield, A. I.

Giles, K. Bollacker, S. Lawrence, "CiteSeer: An Automatic Citation Indexing System," DL\'98 Digital Libraries, 3rd ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 89-98, 1998.</ref> and enabled automatic algorithmic extraction and grouping of citations for any digital academic and scientific document. Where previous citation extraction was a manual process, citation measures could now scale up and be computed for any scholarly and scientific field and document venue, not just those selected by organizations such as ISI. This led to the creation of new systems for public and automated citation indexing, the first being [[CiteSeer]] (now [[CiteSeerX]], soon followed by Cora, which focused primarily on the field of [[computer science]] and [[information science]]. These were later followed by large scale academic domain citation systems such as the Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic. Such autonomous citation indexing is not yet perfect in citation extraction or citation clustering with an error rate estimated by some at 10% though a careful statistical sampling has yet to be done. This has resulted in such authors as [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Milton Keynes]], and [[Walton Hall, Milton Keynes|Walton Hall]] being credited with extensive academic output.<ref name="pmid18354457">{{cite journal |author=Postellon DC |title=Hall and Keynes join Arbor in the citation indexes |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=452 |issue=7185 |page=282 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18354457 |doi=10.1038/452282b}}</ref>  SCI claims to create automatic citation indexing through purely programmatic methods.

S'\'\'\'Cosine similarity\'\'\' is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an [[inner product space]] that measures the [[cosine]] of the angle between them. The cosine of 0\xc2\xb0 is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle. It is thus a judgement of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a Cosine similarity of 1, two vectors at 90\xc2\xb0 have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. Cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in [0,1].\n\nNote that these bounds apply for any number of dimensions, and Cosine similarity is most commonly used in high-dimensional positive spaces. For example, in [[Information Retrieval]] and [[text mining]], each term is notionally assigned a different dimension and a document is characterised by a vector where the value of each dimension corresponds to the number of times that term appears in the document. Cosine similarity then gives a useful measure of how similar two documents are likely to be in terms of their subject matter.<ref>Singhal, Amit (2001). "Modern Information Retrieval: A Brief Overview". Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Data Engineering 24 (4): 35\xe2\x80\x9343.</ref>\n\nThe technique is also used to measure cohesion within [[cluster (computing)|cluster]]s in the field of [[data mining]].<ref>P.-N. Tan, M. Steinbach & V. Kumar, "Introduction to Data Mining", , Addison-Wesley (2005), ISBN 0-321-32136-7, chapter 8; page 500.</ref>\n\n\'\'Cosine distance\'\' is a term often used for the complement in positive space, that is: <math>D_C(A,B) = 1 - S_C(A,B)</math>. It is important to note, however, that this is not a proper [[distance metric]] as it does not have the triangle inequality property and it violates the coincidence axiom; to repair the triangle inequality property whilst maintaining the same ordering, it is necessary to convert to Angular distance (see below.)\n\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of Cosine similarity is that it is very efficient to evaluate, especially for sparse vectors, as only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered.\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe cosine of two vectors can be derived by using the [[Euclidean vector#Dot product|Euclidean dot product]] formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}\n=\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|\\cos\\theta</math>\n\nGiven two [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] of attributes, \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\', the cosine similarity, \'\'cos(\xce\xb8)\'\', is represented using a [[dot product]] and [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] as\n\n:<math>\\text{similarity} = \\cos(\\theta) = {A \\cdot B \\over \\|A\\| \\|B\\|} = \\frac{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i \\times B_i} }{ \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{(A_i)^2}} \\times \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{(B_i)^2}} }</math>\n\nThe resulting similarity ranges from &minus;1 meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 usually indicating independence, and in-between values indicating intermediate similarity or dissimilarity.\n\nFor text matching, the attribute vectors \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' are usually the [[tf-idf|term frequency]] vectors of the documents.  The cosine similarity can be seen as a method of normalizing document length during comparison.\n\nIn the case of [[information retrieval]], the cosine similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies ([[tf-idf]] weights) cannot be negative. The angle between two term frequency vectors cannot be greater than&nbsp;90\xc2\xb0.\n\nIf the attribute vectors are normalized by subtracting the vector means (e.g., <math>A - \\bar{A}</math>), the measure is called centered cosine similarity and is equivalent to the [[Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient#For_a_sample|Pearson Correlation Coefficient]].\n\n=== Angular similarity ===\n\nThe term "cosine similarity" has also been used on occasion to express a different coefficient, although the most common use is as defined above. Using the same calculation of similarity, the normalised angle between the vectors can be used as a bounded similarity function within [0,1], calculated from the above definition of similarity by:\n:<math>1 - \\frac{ \\cos^{-1}( \\text{similarity} )}{ \\pi} </math>\nin a domain where vector coefficients may be positive or negative, or\n:<math>1 - \\frac{ 2 \\cdot \\cos^{-1}( \\text{similarity} ) }{ \\pi }</math>\nin a domain where the vector coefficients are always positive.  \n\nAlthough the term "cosine similarity" has been used for this angular distance, the term is oddly used as the cosine of the angle is used only as a convenient mechanism for calculating the angle itself and is no part of the meaning. The advantage of the angular similarity coefficient is that, when used as a difference coefficient (by subtracting it from 1) the resulting function is a proper [[distance metric]], which is not the case for the first meaning. However for most uses this is not an important property. For any use where only the relative ordering of similarity or distance within a set of vectors is important, then which function is used is immaterial as the resulting order will be unaffected by the choice.\n\n=== Confusion with "Tanimoto" coefficient ===\n\nThe cosine similarity may be easily confused with the Tanimoto metric - a specialised form of a similarity coefficient with a similar algebraic form:\n\n:<math>T(A,B) = {A \\cdot B \\over \\|A\\|^2 +\\|B\\|^2 - A \\cdot B}</math>\n\nIn fact, this algebraic form [[Jaccard index#Tanimoto_Similarity_and_Distance|was first defined by Tanimoto]] as a mechanism for calculating the [[Jaccard coefficient]] in the case where the sets being compared are represented as [[bit vector]]s. While the formula extends to vectors in general, it has quite different properties from cosine similarity and bears little relation other than its superficial appearance.\n\n=== Ochiai coefficient ===\nThis coefficient is also known in biology as Ochiai coefficient, or Ochiai-Barkman coefficient, or Otsuka-Ochiai coefficient:<ref>\'\'Ochiai A.\'\' Zoogeographical studies on the soleoid fishes found Japan and its neighboring regions. II // Bull. Jap. Soc. sci. Fish. 1957. V. 22. \xe2\x84\x96 9. P. 526-530.</ref><ref>\'\'Barkman J.J.\'\' Phytosociology and ecology of cryptogamic epiphytes, including a taxonomic survey and description of their vegetation units in Europe. \xe2\x80\x93 Assen. Van Gorcum. 1958. 628 p.</ref>\n:<math>K =\\frac{n(A \\cap B)}{\\sqrt{n(A) \\times n(B)}}</math>\nHere, <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are sets, and <math>n(A)</math> is the number of elements in <math>A</math>. If sets are represented as [[bit vector]]s, the Ochiai coefficient can be seen to be the same as the cosine similarity.\n\n== Properties ==\nCosine similarity is related to [[Euclidean distance]] as follows. Denote Euclidean distance by the usual <math>\\|A - B\\|</math>, and observe that\n\n:<math>\\|A - B\\|^2 = (A - B)^\\top (A - B) = \\|A\\|^2 + \\|B\\|^2 - 2 A^\\top B</math>\n\nby [[Polynomial expansion|expansion]]. When {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are normalized to unit length, <math>\\|A\\|^2 = \\|B\\|^2 = 1</math> so the previous is equal to\n\n:<math>2 (1 - \\cos(A, B))</math>\n\n\'\'\'Null distribution:\'\'\' For data which can be negative as well as positive, the [[null distribution]] for cosine similarity is the distribution of the dot product of two independent random unit vectors. This distribution has a [[mean]] of zero and a [[variance]] of <math>1/n</math> (where <math>n</math> is the number of dimensions), and although the distribution is bounded between -1 and +1, as <math>n</math> grows large the distribution is increasingly well-approximated by the [[normal distribution]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Spruill, Marcus C\n | year = 2007\n | title = Asymptotic distribution of coordinates on high dimensional spheres\n | journal = Electronic communications in probability\n | volume = 12 | pages = 234-247\n | doi = 10.1214/ECP.v12-1294\n}}</ref><ref>[http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/85916/distribution-of-dot-products-between-two-random-unit-vectors-in-mathbbrd CrossValidated: Distribution of dot products between two random unit vectors in RD]</ref>\nFor other types of data, such as bitstreams (taking values of 0 or 1 only), the null distribution will take a different form, and may have a nonzero mean.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Graham L.

The traditional \'\'\'cosine similarity\'\'\' considers the [[vector space model]] (VSM) features as independent or completely different, while the \'\'\'soft cosine measure\'\'\' proposes considering the similarity of features in VSM, which allows generalization of the concepts of cosine measure and also the idea of similarity (soft similarity).\n\nFor example, in the field of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) the similarity between features is quite intuitive. Features such as words, n-grams or syntactic n-grams<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Grigori|last2=Velasquez|first2=Francisco|last3=Stamatatos|first3=Efstathios|last4=Gelbukh|first4=Alexander|last5=Chanona-Hern\xc3\xa1ndez|first5=Liliana|title=Syntactic Dependency-based N-grams as Classification Features|publisher=LNAI 7630|isbn=978-3-642-37798-3|pages=1\xe2\x80\x9311|url=http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-37798-3_1|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> can be quite similar, though formally they are considered as different features in the VSM. For example, words \xe2\x80\x9cplay\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d are different words and thus are mapped to different dimensions in VSM; yet it is obvious that they are related semantically. In case of [[n-grams]] or syntactic n-grams, [[Levenshtein distance]] can be applied (in fact, Levenshtein distance can be applied to words as well).\n\nFor calculation of the soft cosine measure, the matrix {{math|\'\'\'s\'\'\'}} of similarity between features is introduced. It can be calculated using Levenshtein distance or other similarity measures, e.g., various [[WordNet]] similarity measures. Then we just multiply by this matrix.  \n\nGiven two {{math|\'\'N\'\'}}-dimension vectors a and b, the soft cosine similarity is calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    \\operatorname{soft\\_cosine}_1(a,b)=\n    \\frac{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}a_ib_j}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}a_ia_j}\\sqrt{\\sum\\nolimits_{i,j}^N s_{ij}b_ib_j}},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\'\'s<sub>ij</sub>\'\' {{=}} similarity(feature<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub>, feature<sub>\'\'j\'\'</sub>)}}.\n\nIf there is no similarity between features ({{math|\'\'s<sub>ii</sub>\'\' {{=}} 1}}, {{math|\'\'s<sub>ij</sub>\'\' {{=}} 0}} for {{math|\'\'i\'\' \xe2\x89\xa0 \'\'j\'\'}}), the given equation is equivalent to the conventional cosine similarity formula.\n\nThe complexity of this measure is quadratic, which makes it perfectly applicable to real world tasks. The complexity can be even transformed to linear.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S\xc3\xb8rensen similarity index|S\xc3\xb8rensen\'s quotient of similarity]]\n* [[Hamming distance]]\n* [[Correlation]]\n* [[Dice\'s coefficient]]\n* [[Jaccard index]]\n* [[SimRank]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.appliedsoftwaredesign.com/archives/cosine-similarity-calculator/ Online Cosine Similarity Calculator]\n* [http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5658016&tstart=0 Weighted cosine measure]\n* [http://blog.christianperone.com/?p=2497 A tutorial on cosine similarity using Python]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cosine Similarity}}\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

S"The '''query likelihood model''' is a [[language model]] used in [[Information Retrieval]]. A language model is constructed for each document in the collection.  It is then possible to rank each document by the probability of specific documents given a query. This is interpreted as being the [[Likelihood function|likelihood]] of a document being relevant given a query.\n\n==Calculating the likelihood==\nUsing [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes' rule]], the probability <math>P</math> of a document <math>d</math>, given a query <math>q</math> can be written as follows:\n\n:<math>\n P(d|q) = \\frac{P(q|d) P(d)}{P(q)}\n</math>\n\nSince the probability of the query P(q) is the same for all documents, this can be ignored. Further, it is typical to assume that the probability of documents is uniform. Thus, P(d) is also ignored.\n\n:<math>\n P(d|q) = P(q|d)\n</math>\n\nDocuments are then ranked by the probability that a query is observed as a random sample from the document model. The multinomial unigram language model is commonly used to achieve this. We have:\n:<math>\n P(q|M_d) = K_q \\prod_{t \\in V} P(t|M_d)^{tf_{t,q}}\n</math>,where the multinomial coefficient is <math>K_q = L_q!/(tf_{t1,q}!tf_{t2,q}!...tf_{tM,q}!)</math> for query {{math|q}}.\n\nIn practice the multinomial coefficient is usually removed from the calculation. The reason is that it is a constant for a given bag of words (such as all the words from a specific document <math>d</math>). The language model <math>M_d</math> should be the true language model calculated from the distribution of words underlying each retrieved document. In practice this language model is unknown, so it is usually approximated by considering each term (unigram) from the retrieved document together with its probability of appearance. So <math>P(t|M_d)</math> is the probability of term <math>t</math> being generated by the language model <math>M_d</math> of document <math>d</math>. This probability is multiplied for all terms from query <math>q</math> to get a rank for document <math>d</math> in the interval <math>[0,1]</math>. The calculation is repeated for all documents to create a ranking of all documents in the document collection.\n\n<ref>Christopher D.

It can analyze audio files and automatically determine properties such as the musical key, [[beats per minute]] (BPM), beat intensity and [[ReplayGain]]. \n\nIt supports file types [[MP3]], [[MP4]], [[WAV]], [[FLAC]], [[Ogg|OGG]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[APE tag|APE]].  It helps [[DJs]] to organize and profile their music, and assists in the process of mixing music by utilizing song metadata to be able to show harmonically compatible songs and songs of a similar style.  It allows DJs to save and remember which songs are good matches (like a personal, digital mixing journal) and to plan entire mix sets.\n\nOne of its uses is to assist in a [[DJ]] technique called [[harmonic mixing]]. Once the musical key and BPM is known for a set of songs, [[DJs]] can use [[music theory]] (such as the [[Circle of Fifths]]) to identify songs that are harmonically compatible.  The act of mixing harmonically can help eliminate [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] tones while mixing songs together.  Since identifying whether songs can be made harmonically compatible can be quite complex (once features such as pitch lock are introduced), the software assists DJs by being able to show them which songs in their collection can be made harmonically compatible with any particular song.  It can also assist DJs in the act of [[beatmatching]] by showing which songs are in a compatible BPM range, and the percent of BPM difference.\n\nRapid Evolution is created and released through Mixshare.com.  The metadata generated by Rapid Evolution is shared through the central servers at Mixshare.com, which can be browsed online.  There are 1 million songs added to the database sharing information such as key, BPM, styles and ratings.\n\n==History==\nRapid Evolution was developed for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environment and released in 2003.  Starting in version 2.0 it was switched to run on the Java platform, allowing it to run in virtually any environment.  It is still actively developed.\n\nSeveral improvements to the key detection algorithm have been introduced over the years.  Rapid Evolution is the only program which can detect advanced key modes, such as aeolian, ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian and mixolydian.  To date, there has only been one serious comparison of key detection accuracy (including programs such as [[Mixed In Key]] and Mixmeister).  It was shown that Rapid Evolution is the most accurate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Detection Software Comparison|url=http://www.mixingonbeat.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=2268|date=2006-04-26|accessdate=2008-03-21|publisher=MixingOnBeat}}</ref>\n\nThe program was open-sourced on November 2013. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mixshare.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1381954407|title=Open-sourcing forum thread |date=2013-10-13 |accessdate=2014-04-17 |publisher=Mixshare}}</ref>\n\n==Community interest==\nRapid Evolution was originally a freeware program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mixshare.com/wiki/doku.php?id=testimonials|title=DJ Testimonials |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2008-03-21 |publisher=Mixshare}}</ref>Due to its vast feature set, Rapid Evolution tends to be suited more for experienced DJs versus beginners.  \n\n== See also ==\n*[[Harmonic mixing]]\n*[[Music Theory]]\n*[[DJing]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.mixshare.com/software Download Rapid Evolution]\n*[http://www.mixshare.com Mixshare's Official website]\n*[http://www.harmonic-mixing.com Harmonic-Mixing.com]\n*[https://github.com/djqualia/RapidEvolution2 Source code for version 2]\n*[https://github.com/djqualia/RapidEvolution3 Source code for version 3]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Music search engines]]\n[[Category:OS X multimedia software]]\n[[Category:Windows multimedia software]]\n[[Category:Audio mixing software]]"

S'{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\'\'This article is about the U.S. National Science Foundation Office of Cyberinfrastructure .\n\nOn September 28, 2007, the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] Office of Cyberinfrastructure announced a request for proposals with the name \'\'\'Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partner (DataNet)\'\'\'.<ref name="datanetprogram">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503141\n|publisher=National Science Foundation\n|title=Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners (DataNet) Program Summary\n|date=September 28, 2007\n|accessdate=October 3, 2007\n}}</ref>  The lead paragraph of its synopsis describes the program as:\n\n<blockquote>Science and engineering research and education are increasingly digital and increasingly data-intensive.  Digital data are not only the output of research but provide input to new hypotheses, enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation. Therein lies one of the major challenges of this scientific generation: how to develop the new methods, management structures and technologies to manage the diversity, size, and complexity of current and future data sets and data streams.  This solicitation addresses that challenge by creating a set of exemplar national and global data research infrastructure organizations (dubbed DataNet Partners) that provide unique opportunities to communities of researchers to advance science and/or engineering research and learning.</blockquote>\n\nThe introduction in the solicitation<ref name="datanetsolicitation">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf07601\n|publisher=National Science Foundation\n|title=Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners Program Announcements & Information\n|date=September 28, 2007\n|accessdate=October 3, 2007\n}}</ref> goes on to say:\n\n<blockquote>Chapter 3 (Data, Data Analysis, and Visualization) of [http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf0728/index.jsp NSF\xe2\x80\x99s Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st century Discovery] presents a vision in which \xe2\x80\x9cscience and engineering digital data are routinely deposited in well-documented form, are regularly and easily consulted and analyzed by specialists and non-specialists alike, are openly accessible while suitably protected, and are reliably preserved.\xe2\x80\x9d The goal of this solicitation is to catalyze the development of a system of science and engineering data collections that is open, extensible and evolvable.</blockquote>\n\nThe initial plan called for a $100 million initiative: five awards of $20&nbsp;million each over five years with the possibility of continuing funding.  Awards were given in two rounds. In the first round, for which  full proposals were due on March 21, 2008, two DataNet proposals were awarded.

As such it is used for computing [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] of XML documents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=ftp://ftp.tm.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/pub/papers/ir/An%20Architecture%20for%20XML%20Information%20Retrieval%20in%20a%20Peer-to-Peer%20Environment_2007.pdf|title=An Architecture for XML Information Retrieval in a Peer-to-Peer Environment|last=Winter|first=Judith|author2=Drobnik, Oswald |date=November 9, 2007|publisher=ACM|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Queries==\nMost XML retrieval approaches do so based on techniques from the [[information retrieval]] (IR) area, e.g. by computing the similarity between a query consisting of keywords (query terms) and the document. However, in XML-Retrieval the query can also contain [[Data structure|structural]] [[Hint (SQL)|hints]]. So-called "content and structure" (CAS) queries enable users to specify what structure the requested content can or must have.\n\n==Exploiting XML structure==\nTaking advantage of the [[Self-documenting|self-describing]] structure of XML documents can improve the search for XML documents significantly. This includes the use of CAS queries, the weighting of different XML elements differently and the focused retrieval of subdocuments.\n\n==Ranking==\nRanking in XML-Retrieval can incorporate both content relevance and structural similarity, which is the resemblance between the structure given in the query and the structure of the document. Also, the retrieval units resulting from an XML query may not always be entire documents, but can be any deeply nested XML elements, i.e. dynamic documents. The aim is to find the smallest retrieval unit that is highly relevant. Relevance can be defined according to the notion of specificity, which is the extent to which a retrieval unit focuses on the topic of request.<ref name="INEX2006">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/homepages/andrew/2006-10.pdf|title=Overview of INEX 2006|last=Malik|first=Saadia|author2=Trotman, Andrew |author3=Lalmas, Mounia |author4= Fuhr, Norbert |year=2007|work=Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop of the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Existing XML search engines==\nAn overview of two potential approaches is available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sigmod.org/record/issues/0612/p16-article-yahia.pdf|title=XML Search: Languages, INEX and Scoring|last=Amer-Yahia|first=Sihem|author2=Lalmas, Mounia |year=2006|publisher=SIGMOD Rec.

Also, they apply a static document concept, so retrieval units usually are entire documents.<ref name="Schlieder2002"/> They can be extended to consider structural information and dynamic document retrieval. Examples for approaches extending the vector space models are available: they use document [[subtree]]s (index terms plus structure) as dimensions of the vector space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobase.cs.ucla.edu/tech-docs/sliu/SIGIR04.pdf|title=Configurable Indexing and Ranking for XML Information Retrieval|last=Liu|first=Shaorong|author2=Zou, Qinghua |author3=Chu, Wesley W. |year=2004|work=SIGIR\'04|publisher=ACM|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Document retrieval]]\n*[[Information retrieval applications]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Xml-Retrieval}}\n[[Category:XML]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval]]'

Formally, the nearest-neighbor (NN) search problem is defined as follows: given a set \'\'S\'\' of points in a space \'\'M\'\' and a query point \'\'q\'\'&nbsp;\xe2\x88\x88&nbsp;\'\'M\'\', find the closest point in \'\'S\'\' to \'\'q\'\'. [[Donald Knuth]] in vol. 3 of \'\'[[The Art of Computer Programming]]\'\' (1973) called it the \'\'\'post-office problem\'\'\', referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office. A direct generalization of this problem is a \'\'k\'\'-NN search, where we need to find the \'\'k\'\' closest points.\n\nMost commonly \'\'M\'\' is a  [[metric space]] and dissimilarity is expressed as a [[distance metric]], which is symmetric and satisfies the [[triangle inequality]]. Even more common, \'\'M\'\' is taken to be the \'\'d\'\'-dimensional [[vector space]] where dissimilarity is measured using the [[Euclidean distance]], [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]] or other [[Statistical distance|distance metric]]. However, the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary. One example are asymmetric [[Bregman divergence]]s, for which the triangle inequality does not hold.<ref name=Cayton2008>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Cayton | first1 = Lawerence\n | year = 2008\n | title =  Fast nearest neighbor retrieval for bregman divergences.\n | journal = Proceedings of the 25th international conference on Machine learning\n | pages = 112\xe2\x80\x93119\n}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe nearest neighbor search problem arises in numerous fields of application, including:\n*[[Pattern recognition]] - in particular for [[optical character recognition]]\n*[[Statistical classification]]- see [[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]]\n*[[Computer vision]]\n*[[Computational Geometry]] - see [[Closest pair of points problem]]\n*[[Database]]s - e.g. [[content-based image retrieval]]\n*[[Coding theory]] - see [[Decoding methods|maximum likelihood decoding]]\n*[[Data compression]] - see [[MPEG-2]] standard\n*[[Recommender system|Recommendation systems]], e.g. see [[Collaborative filtering]]\n*[[Internet marketing]] - see [[contextual advertising]] and [[behavioral targeting]]\n*[[DNA sequencing]]\n*[[Spell checking]] - suggesting correct spelling\n*[[Plagiarism detection]]\n*[[Contact searching algorithms in FEA]]\n*[[Similarity score]]s for predicting career paths of professional athletes.\n*[[Cluster analysis]] - assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are similar in some sense, usually based on [[Euclidean distance]]\n*[[Chemical similarity]]\n*[[Motion planning#Sampling-Based Algorithms|Sampling-Based Motion Planning]]\n\n==Methods==\n\nVarious solutions to the NNS problem have been proposed.  The quality and usefulness of the algorithms are determined by the time complexity of queries as well as the space complexity of any search data structures that must be maintained. The informal observation usually referred to as the [[curse of dimensionality]] states that there is no general-purpose exact solution for NNS in high-dimensional Euclidean space using polynomial preprocessing and polylogarithmic search time.\n\n===Linear search===\nThe simplest solution to the NNS problem is to compute the distance from the query point to every other point in the database, keeping track of the "best so far".  This algorithm, sometimes referred to as the naive approach, has a [[running time]] of \'\'O\'\'(\'\'dN\'\') where \'\'N\'\' is the [[cardinality]] of \'\'S\'\' and \'\'d\'\' is the dimensionality of \'\'M\'\'.  There are no search data structures to maintain, so linear search has no space complexity beyond the storage of the database. Naive search can, on average, outperform space partitioning approaches on higher dimensional spaces.<ref>{{cite web|title=A quantitative analysis and performance study for similarity search methods in high dimensional spaces|author=Weber, Schek, Blott | url=http://www.vldb.org/conf/1998/p194.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Space partitioning===\nSince the 1970s, [[branch and bound]] methodology has been applied to the problem. In the case of Euclidean space this approach is known as [[spatial index]] or spatial access methods. Several [[Space partitioning|space-partitioning]] methods have been developed for solving the NNS problem.  Perhaps the simplest is the [[k-d tree]], which iteratively bisects the search space into two regions containing half of the points of the parent region.  Queries are performed via traversal of the tree from the root to a leaf by evaluating the query point at each split. Depending on the distance specified in the query, neighboring branches that might contain hits may also need to be evaluated. For constant dimension query time, average complexity is \'\'O\'\'(log&nbsp;\'\'N\'\') <ref>{{cite web|title=An introductory tutorial on KD trees|author=Andrew Moore | url=http://www.autonlab.com/autonweb/14665/version/2/part/5/data/moore-tutorial.pdf?branch=main&language=en}}</ref> in the case of randomly distributed points, worst case complexity analyses have been performed.<ref name=Lee1977>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Lee | first1 = D.

Particular examples include [[vp-tree]] and [[BK-tree]].\n\nUsing a set of points taken from a 3-dimensional space and put into a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]], and given a query point taken from the same space, a possible solution to the problem of finding the nearest point-cloud point to the query point is given in the following description of an algorithm.  (Strictly speaking, no such point may exist, because it may not be unique.  But in practice, usually we only care about finding any one of the subset of all point-cloud points that exist at the shortest distance to a given query point.)  The idea is, for each branching of the tree, guess that the closest point in the cloud resides in the half-space containing the query point.  This may not be the case, but it is a good heuristic.  After having recursively gone through all the trouble of solving the problem for the guessed half-space, now compare the distance returned by this result with the shortest distance from the query point to the partitioning plane.  This latter distance is that between the query point and the closest possible point that could exist in the half-space not searched.  If this distance is greater than that returned in the earlier result, then clearly there is no need to search the other half-space.  If there is such a need, then you must go through the trouble of solving the problem for the other half space, and then compare its result to the former result, and then return the proper result.  The performance of this algorithm is nearer to logarithmic time than linear time when the query point is near the cloud, because as the distance between the query point and the closest point-cloud point nears zero, the algorithm needs only perform a look-up using the query point as a key to get the correct result.\n\n===Locality sensitive hashing===\n\n[[Locality sensitive hashing]] (LSH) is a technique for grouping points in space into \'buckets\' based on some distance metric operating on the points. Points that are close to each other under the chosen metric are mapped to the same bucket with high probability.<ref>{{cite web|author=A. Rajaraman and J. Ullman| url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html |title=Mining of Massive Datasets, Ch. 3. |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n===Nearest neighbor search in spaces with small intrinsic dimension===\n\nThe [[cover tree]] has a theoretical bound that is based on the dataset\'s [[doubling constant]]. The bound on search time is \'\'O\'\'(\'\'c\'\'<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;log&nbsp;\'\'n\'\') where \'\'c\'\'  is the [[Expansivity constant|expansion constant]] of the dataset.\n\n===Vector approximation files===\n\nIn high dimensional spaces, tree indexing structures become useless because an increasing percentage of the nodes need to be examined anyway. To speed up linear search, a compressed version of the feature vectors stored in RAM is used to prefilter the datasets in a first run. The final candidates are determined in a second stage using the uncompressed data from the disk for distance calculation.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Approximation-Based Data Structure for Similarity Search|author=Weber, Blott}}</ref>\n\n===Compression/clustering based search===\nThe VA-file approach is a special case of a compression based search, where each feature component is compressed uniformly and independently. The optimal compression technique in multidimensional spaces is Vector Quantization (VQ), implemented through clustering. The database is clustered and the most "promising" clusters are retrieved. Huge gains over VA-File, tree-based indexes and sequential scan have been observed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for similarity search in image databases|author=Ramaswamy, Rose, ICIP 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for high-dimensional indexing|author=Ramaswamy, Rose, TKDE 2010}}</ref> Also note the parallels between clustering and LSH.\n\n===Greedy walks===\nOne possible way to solve NNS is to construct a graph <math>G(V,E)</math>, where every point <math>x_i \\in S </math> is uniquely associated with vertex <math>v_i \\in V </math>. The search of the point in the set \'\'S\'\' closest to the query \'\'q\'\' takes the form of the search of vertex in the graph <math>G(V,E)</math>.\nOne of the basic vertex search algorithms in graphs with metric objects is the greedy search algorithm. It starts from the random vertex <math>v_i \\in V </math>. The algorithm computes a distance value from the query q to each vertex from the neighborhood <math>\\{v_j:(v_i,v_j) \\in E\\}</math> of  the current vertex <math>v_i</math>, and then selects a vertex with the minimal distance value. If the distance value between the query and the selected vertex is smaller than the one between the query and the current element, then the algorithm moves to the selected vertex, and it becomes new current vertex. The algorithm stops when it reaches a local minimum: a vertex whose neighborhood does not contain a vertex that is closer to the query than the vertex itself.\nThis idea was exploited in VoroNet system <ref name=voroNet>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Olivier | first1 = Beaumont  \n | last2 = Kermarrec | first2 = Anne-Marie\n | last3 = Marchal | first3 = Loris \n | last4 = Rivi\xc3\xa8re | first4 = Etienne   \n | year = 2006\n | title = VoroNet: A scalable object network based on Voronoi tessellations\n | journal = INRIA\n | volume = RR-5833\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 23\xe2\x80\x9329\n | doi = 10.1007/BF00263763\n | postscript = .\n}}</ref> for the plane, in RayNet system <ref name=rayNet>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Olivier | first1 = Beaumont  \n | last2 = Kermarrec | first2 = Anne-Marie\n | last4 = Rivi\xc3\xa8re | first4 = Etienne   \n | year = 2007\n | title = Peer to Peer Multidimensional Overlays: Approximating Complex Structures\n | journal = Principles of Distributed Systems\n | volume =  4878\n | issue = .\n | pages = 315\xe2\x80\x93328\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-77096-1_23\n | isbn = 978-3-540-77095-4\n | postscript = .\n}}</ref> for the <math>\\mathbb{E}^n</math> and for the general metric space in Metrized Small World algorithm <ref name=msw2014>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Malkov | first1 = Yury  \n | last2 = Ponomarenko | first2 = Alexander\n | last3 = Krylov | first3 = Vladimir \n | last4 = Logvinov | first4 = Andrey   \n | year = 2014\n | title = Approximate nearest neighbor algorithm based on navigable small world graphs\n | journal = Information Systems\n | volume = 45\n | pages = 61\xe2\x80\x9368\n | doi = 10.1016/j.is.2013.10.006\n | postscript = .\n}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\nThere are numerous variants of the NNS problem and the two most well-known are the [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|\'\'k\'\'-nearest neighbor search]] and the [[&epsilon;-approximate nearest neighbor search]].\n\n===<span id="K-nearest neighbor"> \'\'k\'\'-nearest neighbor </span>===\n\n[[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|\'\'k\'\'-nearest neighbor search]] identifies the top \'\'k\'\' nearest neighbors to the query.  This technique is commonly used in predictive analytics to estimate or classify a point based on the consensus of its neighbors. \'\'k\'\'-nearest neighbor graphs are graphs in which every point is connected to its \'\'k\'\' nearest neighbors.\n\n===Approximate nearest neighbor===\nIn some applications it may be acceptable to retrieve a "good guess" of the nearest neighbor. In those cases, we can use an algorithm which doesn\'t guarantee to return the actual nearest neighbor in every case, in return for improved speed or memory savings. Often such an algorithm will find the nearest neighbor in a majority of cases, but this depends strongly on the dataset being queried.\n\nAlgorithms that support the approximate nearest neighbor search include [[Locality-sensitive hashing#LSH algorithm for nearest neighbor search|locality-sensitive hashing]], [[best bin first]] and [[balanced box-decomposition tree]] based search.<ref>S. Arya, [[David Mount|D. M. Mount]], [[Nathan Netanyahu|N. S. Netanyahu]], R. Silverman and A. Wu, An optimal algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching, Journal of the ACM, 45(6):891-923, 1998. [http://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/arya/pub/JACM.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Nearest neighbor distance ratio===\n\n[[Nearest neighbor distance ratio]] do not apply the threshold on the direct distance from the original point to the challenger neighbor but on a ratio of it depending on the distance to the previous neighbor. It is used in [[Content-based image retrieval|CBIR]] to retrieve pictures through a "query by example" using the similarity between local features. More generally it is involved in several [[Pattern matching|matching]] problems.\n\n===Fixed-radius near neighbors===\n\n[[Fixed-radius near neighbors]] is the problem where one wants to efficiently find all points given in [[Euclidean space]] within a given fixed distance from a specified point. The data structure should work on a distance which is fixed however the query point is arbitrary.\n\n===All nearest neighbors===\n\nFor some applications (e.g. [[entropy estimation]]), we may have \'\'N\'\' data-points and wish to know which is the nearest neighbor \'\'for every one of those N points\'\'. This could of course be achieved by running a nearest-neighbor search once for every point, but an improved strategy would be an algorithm that exploits the information redundancy between these \'\'N\'\' queries to produce a more efficient search. As a simple example: when we find the distance from point \'\'X\'\' to point \'\'Y\'\', that also tells us the distance from point \'\'Y\'\' to point \'\'X\'\', so the same calculation can be reused in two different queries.\n\nGiven a fixed dimension, a semi-definite positive norm (thereby including every  [[lp space|L<sup>p</sup> norm]]), and \'\'n\'\' points in this space, the nearest neighbour of every point can be found in \'\'O\'\'(\'\'n\'\'&nbsp;log&nbsp;\'\'n\'\') time and the \'\'m\'\' nearest neighbours of every point can be found in \'\'O\'\'(\'\'mn\'\'&nbsp;log&nbsp;\'\'n\'\') time.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Clarkson | first = Kenneth L. | author-link = Kenneth L.

S'{{COI|date=July 2014}}\n{{Original research|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\'\'\'Multimedia Information Retrieval\'\'\' (MMIR or MIR) is a research discipline of [[computer science]] that aims at extracting semantic information from [[multimedia]] data sources.<ref>H Eidenberger. " Fundamental Media Understanding ", atpress, 2011, p. 1.</ref>{{FV|date=July 2014}} Data sources include directly perceivable media such as [[Content (media and publishing)|audio]], [[image]] and [[video]], indirectly perceivable sources such as [[Written language|text]], biosignals as well as not perceivable sources such as bioinformation, stock prices, etc. The methodology of MMIR can be organized in three groups:\n\n# Methods for the summarization of media content ([[feature extraction]]). The result of feature extraction is a description.\n# Methods for the filtering of media descriptions (for example, elimination of [[Data redundancy|redundancy]])\n# Methods for the [[categorization]] of media descriptions into classes.\n\n== Feature Extraction Methods ==\n\nFeature extraction is motivated by the sheer size of multimedia objects as well as their redundancy and, possibly, noisiness.<ref>H Eidenberger. " Fundamental Media Understanding ", atpress, 2011, p. 2.</ref>{{FV|date=July 2014}} Generally, two possible goals can be achieved by feature extraction:\n\n* Summarization of media content. Methods for summarization include in the audio domain, for example, [[Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients]], Zero Crossings Rate, Short-Time Energy. In the visual domain, color histograms<ref>A Del Bimbo. " Visual Information Retrieval ", Morgan Kaufmann, 1999.</ref> such as the [[MPEG-7]] Scalable Color Descriptor can be used for summarization.\n* Detection of patterns by [[auto-correlation]] and/or [[cross-correlation]]. Patterns are recurring media chunks that can either be detected by comparing chunks over the media dimensions (time, space, etc.) or comparing media chunks to templates (e.g. face templates, phrases). Typical methods include Linear Predictive Coding in the audio/biosignal domain,<ref>HG Kim , N Moreau, T Sikora. " MPEG-7 Audio and Beyond", Wiley, 2005.</ref> texture description in the visual domain and n-grams in text information retrieval.\n\n== Merging and Filtering Methods ==\n\nMultimedia Information Retrieval implies that multiple channels are employed for the understanding of media content.<ref>MS Lew (Ed.). " Principles of Visual Information Retrieval ", Springer, 2001.</ref> Each of this channels is described by media-specific feature transformations. The resulting descriptions have to be merged to one description per media object. Merging can be performed by simple concatenation if the descriptions are of fixed size. Variable-sized descriptions - as they frequently occur in motion description - have to be normalized to a fixed length first.\n\nFrequently used methods for description filtering include [[factor analysis]] (e.g. by PCA), singular value decomposition (e.g. as latent semantic indexing in text retrieval) and the extraction and testing of statistical moments. Advanced concepts such as the [[Kalman filter]] are used for merging of descriptions.\n\n== Categorization Methods ==\n\nGenerally, all forms of machine learning can be employed for the categorization of multimedia descriptions<ref>H Eidenberger. " Fundamental Media Understanding ", atpress, 2011,p. 125.</ref>{{FV|date=July 2014}} though some methods are more frequently used in one area than another. For example, [[Hidden Markov models]] are state-of-the-art in [[speech recognition]], while [[Dynamic Time Warping]] - a semantically related method - is state-of-the-art in gene sequence alignment. The list of applicable classifiers includes the following:\n\n* Metric approaches ([[Cluster Analysis]], [[Vector Space Model]], [[Minkowski]] Distances, Dynamic Alignment)\n* Nearest Neighbor methods ([[K-nearest neighbors algorithm]], K-Means, [[Self-Organizing Map]])\n* Risk Minimization (Support Vector Regression, [[Support Vector Machine]], [[Linear Discriminant Analysis]])\n* Density-based Methods (Bayes Nets, [[Markov Processes]], Mixture Models)\n* Neural Networks ([[Perceptron]], Associative Memories, Spiking Nets)\n* Heuristics ([[Decision Trees]], Random Forests, etc.)\n\nThe selection of the best classifier for a given problem (test set with descriptions and class labels, so-called [[ground truth]]) can be performed automatically, for example, using the [[Weka]] Data Miner.\n\n== Open Problems ==\n\nThe quality of MMIR Systems<ref>JC Nordbotten. "[http://nordbotten.com/ADM/ADM_book/MIRS-frame.htm Multimedia Information Retrieval Systems]". Retrieved 14 October 2011.</ref> depends heavily on the quality of the training data. Discriminative descriptions can be extracted from media sources in various forms. Machine learning provides categorization methods for all types of data. However, the classifier can only be as good as the given training data. On the other hand, it requires considerable effort to provide class labels for large databases. The future success of MMIR will depend on the provision of such data.<ref>H Eidenberger. " Frontiers of Media Understanding ", atpress, 2012.</ref> The annual [[TRECVID]] competition is currently one of the most relevant sources of high-quality ground truth.\n\n== Related Areas ==\n\nMMIR provides an overview over methods employed in the areas of information retrieval.<ref>H Eidenberger. " Professional Media Understanding ", atpress, 2012.</ref> Methods of one area are adapted and employed on other types of media. Multimedia content is merged before the classification is performed. MMIR methods are, therefore, usually reused from other areas such as:\n\n* [[Bioinformatics|Bioinformation Analysis]]\n* [[Biosignal|Biosignal Processing]]\n* [[Content-based image retrieval|Content-based Image and Video Retrieval]]\n* [[Facial recognition system|Face Recognition]]\n* [[Music information retrieval|Audio and Music Classification]]\n* [[Speech Recognition]]\n* [[Technical analysis|Technical Chart Analysis]]\n* [[Information retrieval|Text Information Retrieval]]\n\nThe Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval<ref>"[http://www.springer.com/computer/journal/13735 Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval]", Springer, 2011, Retrieved 21 October 2011.</ref> documents the development of MMIR as a research discipline that is independent of these areas. See also <ref>H Eidenberger. " Handbook of Multimedia Information Retrieval ", atpress, 2012.</ref> for a complete overview over this research discipline.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!--\n\n<ref>AUTH.
